# Does Descartes attack belief or only knowledge?

Should we consider Descartes an ancient or a modern sceptic? Scholars often say
that ancient scepticism attacks belief while modern scepticism attacks only
knowledge. (See, for example, the sources that Gail Fine cites in “Descartes
and Ancient Skepticism: Reheated Cabbage?”, *Philosophical Review*, Volume 109,
Number 2 (April 2000), note 1, page 195.) Let’s assume that this contrast is
true for the most part: ancient scepticism attempts to show that we have no
more reason to believe x than ~x in order to encourage ἐποχή, suspension of
judgment. Modern skepticism, by contrast, attempts to challenge whether we have
sufficient grounds to say that we know x, without necessarily arguing that we
should give up believing x. (Our belief, for example, may still be warranted,
but the warrant is not sufficient for us to say that we know.) Our question is
which side of this divide does Descartes fall on? Is he, in this regard, more
like an ancient or a modern sceptic?

Gail Fine argues that Descartes falls on the ancient side of this divide. (In
fact, she argues that Descartes is more like ancient than modern scepticism in
several ways, but I’ll only focus on this one issue: do they attack belief or
knowledge.) After reviewing her arguments, I want to add an important one that
I think she skips. One note: Fine believes that sceptics “lack beliefs about
anything unclear”, but that “they do have some beliefs” (208). So their attack
on belief may be radical but it is not absolute. She argues that Descartes
believes that the sceptics have no beliefs, but this should not affect the main
lines of what follows.

Before offering her own arguments, Fine shows that Descartes himself believes
that ancient sceptics disavow belief and not merely knowledge. She cites
a letter where Descartes writes that they have the “intention and resolve...of
doubting everything” (AT 3:433-434, to Hyperaspistes, August 1641). This does
not yet necessarily prove anything about Descartes’s own scepticism, but it is
useful to know nevertheless.

In bullet points, here is what Fine offers in support of the claim that
Descartes attacks beliefs.

+ Descartes says that he intends to withold from all uncertain and doubtful
  opinions “just as carefully as...from those which are patently false”. If
  someone considers something patently false, then (i) they certainly don’t
  know that thing, but at the same time (ii) they don’t (can’t?) believe that
  thing.
+ At the start of the second meditation, Descartes writes that he will set
  aside anything that admits of the slightest doubt as if it were completely
  false. As above, if we deal with something “as if it were completely false”,
  then we cannot believe it, at least under normal circumstances or given
  a standard understanding of “believe”.
+ Decartes thinks that doubting means neither affirming nor denying. Insofar as
  this is suspension of belief, Descartes cannot believe what he doubts since
  he does not affirm it or deny it.
+ Descartes rejects “many of his pre-reflextive beliefs” in the course of the
  *Meditations*. As an example, Fine agrees with Wilson that he rejects various
  beliefs based on the senses.
