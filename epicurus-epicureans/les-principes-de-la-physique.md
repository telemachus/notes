# “Les principes de la physique”, Alain Gigandet in *Lire Épicure et les épicuriens*, 49-71.

## A scandalous meeting

Gigandet (hereafter “G”) begins with a story from Plutarch. In his *Against Colotes*, Plutarch tells the story of a meeting between Colotes and Epicurus (1100A-C). Colotes prostrated himself before Epicurus as if Epicurus were a god, and Epicurus did the same for Colotes. Plutarch uses this to mock the Epicureans, but G draws a different conclusion. According to G, this shows that the study of physics is something “divine and it renders divine those who devote themselves to it by guaranteeing them a peace like that which the gods enjoy” (49).

## The basics

According to G, the basic principles of Epicurean physics are easily stated, but it takes something more to produce the state of divine serenity. Here are the principles: (i) An infinite number of microscopic particles (ii) in perpetual movement (iii) in an infinite void (iv) create everything that exists (v) through their random collisions.
