# On not knowing Meno at all

> ἐγὼ οὖν καὶ αὐτός, ὦ Μένων, οὕτως ἔχω: συμπένομαι τοῖς πολίταις τούτου τοῦ πράγματος, καὶ ἐμαυτὸν καταμέμφομαι ὡς οὐκ εἰδὼς περὶ ἀρετῆς τὸ παράπαν: ὃ δὲ μὴ οἶδα τί ἐστιν, πῶς ἂν ὁποῖόν γέ τι εἰδείην; ἢ δοκεῖ σοι οἷόν τε εἶναι, ὅστις Μένωνα μὴ γιγνώσκει τὸ παράπαν ὅστις ἐστίν, τοῦτον εἰδέναι εἴτε καλὸς εἴτε πλούσιος εἴτε καὶ γενναῖός ἐστιν, εἴτε καὶ τἀναντία τούτων; δοκεῖ σοι οἷόν τ᾽ εἶναι; (Meno 71b1-8)

People take this to mean that "If Socrates is a complete cognitive blank about Meno, then he can't know anything about him." And this interpretation, in turn, guides how people read Meno's later challenge and the paradox that comes out of it (at 80). Terry Irwin, Dominic Scott, and Gail fine, for example, all interpret the dilemma to be "Either you have knowledge of x or you are in complete ignorance of x".

While this interpretation of 71b is certainly possible, it is not necessary, and it is not the best reading even of the initial passage. Thus, we should not rely on it to infer anything about 80.
