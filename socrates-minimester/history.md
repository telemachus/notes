# History notes for minimester

## *Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece*

* Greeks borrowed two alphabets for their own language, but one stuck. The first, Linear B, shows up in Crete and the mainland in the Mycenean era, roughly 1600-1100. The second was borrowed later, roughly 800-700, from the Phoenicians of modern Lebanon. It is effectively the Hebrew alphabet, but adapted to the Greek language. E.g., some consonants became vowels.
* Around 500BCE, Greek culture and language extended as far west as the Straits of Gibraltar, called by the ancient Greeks “the Pillars of Hercules,” to Colchis, in modern Georgia at the far end of the Black Sea.
* Even in antiquity itself, the period of 500-300BCE was considered the classical era of Greek literature, art, and thought.
* Athens was the center of fifth- and fourth-century classical Greek culture.
* Two important wars in the lifetime of Socrates: Persian war, circa 490-479, and Peloponnesian war, circa 431-404.
* Democracy was introduced to Athens in 508/507.
* The archaeological record shows both commuters who lived in the city and worked farms outside the city and people who may have lived on their farms, either year-round or in busy seasons.
* Ancient farmers grew mostly the “Mediterranean triad”: olives, cereals, and vines. They also grew beans and chick peas, which help to refertilize the soil. Although oxen and horses were too expensive for most farmers, even small farms would usually have smaller animals: sheep, goats, pigs, bees.

### *Intermezzo: Historical Outline c. 1500-146 BCE*

* 1500 BCE is an easy-to-remember date; there’s no specific historical even there. In 146 BCE, however, the Romans took overmost of the Greek world.
* 1500 BCE is the Late Bronze Age or the Mycenean period.
* In the Mycenean period, we find graft shafts for aristocrats in Mycenae. People initially connected these with Homer’s heroes, but this is guesswork at best. There was a spike in this society in the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries.
* In around 1200, however, something goes very wrong. The palaces are destroyed, populations scatter, cities shrink and grow poorer, and writing disappears. People call this the start of a Greek Dark Age.
* We see a wave of colonization in the eighth and seventh centuries.
* Around the s ame time as the new colonies go out, we see the rise of the *polis* or citizen-state.
* Hoplite warfare emerges in the 600s BCE. Richer citizens fight on horseback, and poorer citizens as light-armed support troops or served as the crew on ships.
* There was also a rise in tyrrany in the seventh century.
* Sparta never experiences tyrrany. There are flirtations with tyranny in Athens, but they begin late (the 600s BCE). Solon passes reforms in 594 BCE that are proto-democratic (?), but that leads to tyranny. However, Pisistratus and his sons rule in somewhat unusual ways. They keep Solon’s reforms, and they encourage national Athenian pride and unity. Ultimately, the actions of the Pisistratids lead (oddly) to democracy.
* After a Greek revolt in the 490s, Darius I launched an attack on Marathon in 490. The Greeks won although they were greatly outnumbered.
* After Darius I dies, his son Xerxes launches another attack against the Greeks in 480. The Athenians lead Greek forces to defeat the Persians in a sea battle at Salamis (480), and the Spartans lead ground forces to defeat the Persians on land at Platea (479). Both cities become important: the Spartans lead the Peloponnesian League, and the Athenians lead the Delian League.
* Later, the Spartans and Athenians turn on each other. They fight a first Peloponnesian war (460-445), and then a, much more famous, war from 431-404. This second war was back and forth, but after the Athenian disaster in Sicily (415-413), Sparta steadily takes the advantage and wins.
* Placeholder for revolutions in Athens, pre- and post-Peloponnesian war.
