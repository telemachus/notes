# Notes on *Genealogy of Morals*

## Preface

In the preface, Nietzsche writes that the GM is about "the *origins* of our
moral prejudices" (1, emphasis Nietzsche's).  I suspect that this means that he
(generally?) takes *moral* and its cognates in a pejorative sense though I grant
that the little he says here does not require such a sense.  Still, I suspect he
(like Williams) thinks of morality as a problem, as wrong, as something bad for
us or false in significant ways.

Nietzsche also tells us that he first wrote about the origins of morality in
*Human, All Too Human* in 1876, but that he had been thinking about these issues
before that and that he writes about the same ideas in GM, which was published
ten years after HATH in 1887.

Nietzsche says that his "characteristic" skepticism, which appeared "so early in
[his] life" led him "inevitabl[y]" to ask "*what*, in face, is the *origin* of
our good and evil?" (2, emphases Nietzsche's).  (Nietzsche says that he thought
about "the problem of the origin of evil" as early as thirteen (2).)  Initially,
Nietzsche assigned the origin of evil to god, but over time he lost any tendency
to seek "the origin of evil *behind* the world" (2, Nietzsche's emphasis).
Instead, after "[a] little historical and philological schooling," Nietzsche
began to ask different questions (2):

> under what conditions did man invent those value judgments good and evil?
> *and what value do they themselves have?*  Have they inhibited or furthered
> human flourishing up until now?  Are they a sign of distress, of
> impoverishment, of the degeneration of life?  Or, conversely, do they betray
> the fullness, the power, the will of life, its courage, its confidence, its
> future (2, emphasis Nietzsche's)?

Nietzsche stresses that he came to care more about the value of morality than
its origins.  (Keep this in mind as I read the GM.)  Nietzsche describes the
admiration "of compassion, self-denial, self-sacrifice" as a turn towards "a new
Buddhism...a Buddhism for Europeans...*nihilism*" (4).  Note also that Nietzsche
insists that earlier philosophers, even ones who he disagrees with vehemently,
such as Plato and Kant, had "low regard for compassion" (4).  Thus, he sees the
"preferential treatment and overestimation of compassion" as "something new"
(4).  By *new* he seems to mean of 1800s, but I am not certain about this.

Nietzsche cares about the origin of morality *because* he cares (far more) about
the value of morality.  He puts it in the following way:

> we need a *critique* of moral values, *for once the value of these values must
> itself be called into question—and for this we need a knowledge of the
> conditions and circumstances out of which they have grown, under which they
> have developed and shifted (morality as consequence, as symptom, as mask, as
> Tartuffery, as sickness, as misunderstanding; but also morality as cause, as
> medicine, as stimulus, as inhibitor, as poison), knowledge of a kind that hs
> neither existed up until now nor even been desired (5, emphases Nietzsche's).

## First Treatise

Nietzsche begins by attacking those he calls "English psychologists" (9).
According to them, our ideas of good and evil derive from a forgotten utility.
People call things *good* insofar as they are useful to themselves, but over
time the personal perspective drops out.  Thus, eventually people thing of what
is useful as simply and completely that which is good.

By contrast, Nietzsche insists that the idea of *good* comes from the nobility,
the powerful, the aristocratic.  Those people call *good* that which is theirs,
like themselves, and from themselves.  By contrast, these nobles call *bad* that
which is far from them, namely that which is common, base, without power and
status.

Note that there are two very different contrasts here.  The terms *good* and
*bad* do not pick out the same contrast as the terms *good* and *evil*.

Nietzsche also argues that the contrast between *egoistic* and *unegoistic*
values and actions only emerges "when aristocratic value judgments begin to
*decline*" (11, Nietzsche's emphasis).

Nietzsche claims that he came to his answer by a study of language.  When he
looked at the various words for *good*, he discovered that they all originally
derive from *noble* or *aristocratic*.  At the same time, he discovered that the
origin of words for *bad* come from *common*, *vulgar*, *base*, or, in general,
the opposite of what is noble and aristocratic.  (As an aside: is this true?)

Nietzsche seems to attribute the development of the pair *good* and *evil* to
contexts where the nobility were also priests.  In such cases, the priests, of
course, thought of themselves as the *good*.  Initially, they contrasted
themselves as good and pure with the *impure*.  Over time, however, the impure
began to be thought of as *evil*.  (The course of this change is not clear to
me.)  Nietzsche describes priests as "the most evil enemies" precisely because
they are "the most powerless" (16).  As he continues, "Out of their
powerlessness their hate grows into something enormous and uncanny, into
something most spiritual and most poisonous" (16).

Ultimately, the priests, in the form of "the Jews," by which paradoxically
Nietzsche seems to mean "the Christians," inverted the old values of the
nobility.  For the nobles of old "good = noble = powerful = beautiful = happy
= beloved of God" (16).  The priests will take all of the internal terms (i.e.,
everything except "good" and "beloved of god") and replace them with their
opposites.  Those who are miserable, ugly, weak, lowly, and powerless turn out
to be the good and the beloved of god.  After this inversion, the noble and
powerful turn out to be—no longer *bad* but *evil*.  Nietzsche calls this
inversion "the slave revolt in morality" (17).

Nietzsche also insists that nobles and priests create values in fundamentally
different ways.  Nobles create out of joy and triumph; they say "Yes" and create
new values through action.  Priests create out of *ressentiment* and weakness;
they say "No" and create through intrigue and indirection.  Vulgar morality is
reactive while noble morality is active and self-activating.

Both nobles and slaves make mistakes, but even their mistakes are different and
spring from different sources.  The nobles make mistakes because of ignorance or
contempt for the base that they see as far from them.  The vulgar, on the other
hand, make mistakes out of jealousy, *ressentiment*, and as a form of revenge.
Most of all, in Nietzsche's eyes, the nobles make honest mistakes and act always
out of honesty while the vulgar naturally and inevitably lie and deceive.  In
particular, the vulgar lie—and must lie—even to themselves.  They cannot get
where they want by honest means, so they must—and do—lie in order to reach their
goals.

Nietzsche takes a similar path to explain the origin of *evil* as the vulgar
conceive it.  Noble people, according to Nietzsche, long for (and even love)
a strong and equally noble enemy.  The noble ones do not hate or resent their
noble enemies.  The vulgar, on the other hand, lack power and sincerity.  As
a result, when they think of an enemy, they must belittle and diminish that
person.  As a result, the vulgar create and conceive the opposite of good as
something twisted and evil.

In fact, Nietzsche takes things one step further.  Since the vulgar are by
nature passive and reactive, they only develop their concept of "good" after and
in contrast to their concept of evil.  For the noble, *good* comes first, but
for the vulgar, *evil* comes first.  The vulgar can only define themselves in
opposition to their (imagined) enemy, but the noble take themselves as the
positive form of good first.  They only define *bad* later, as an afterthought.

Nietzsche also describes as inevitable what the vulgar insist are acts of free
will.  For example, the (true) good do not *choose* to act on their strength,
i.e., to conquer, rape, and plunder.  The nobles are no different than birds of
prey: they will of course kill and consume weaker animals.  By the same token,
the vulgar themselves are not humble and obedient out of active, freely chosen
goodness.  They can do nothing else than be passive, cowardly recipients of
whatever the world and the strong do to them.
