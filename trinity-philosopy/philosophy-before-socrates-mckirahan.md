# *Philosophy Before Socrates* Richard D. McKirahan (Hackett, 2010, 2nd ed.)

## Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes

(NB: I should go back and do these in more detail at some point.)

In a nutshell, McKirahan focuses on the Milesians proto-scientific method. That is, they attempt to explain things not via supernatural means but by the observed properties of natural things and by reasoned argument.
