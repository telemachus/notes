# How many types of philosophy are there?

## Introduction

How many types of philosophers are there? Put baldly like this and without any context, the question probably doesn’t look very promising. In fact, it may seem more like a game for doxographers than a serious philosophical inquiry. Nevertheless, I believe that we can learn something important about the aims of Sextus Empiricus and how he understands Pyrrhonian scepticism by comparing his answer with that of Diogenes Laertius.

Diogenes and Sextus employ similar criteria, but Diogenes divides philosophers into two groups, while Sextus divides them into three. Diogenes offers the following division:
> Τῶν δὲ φιλοσόφων οἱ μὲν γεγόνασι δογματικοί, οἱ δ᾿ ἐφεκτικοί· δογματικοὶ μὲν ὅσοι περὶ τῶν πραγμάτων ἀποφαίνονται ὡς καταληπτῶν· ἐφεκτικοὶ δὲ ὅσοι ἐπέχουσι περὶ αὐτῶν ὡς ἀκαταλήπτων.
> Some philosophers have been dogmatists, and others are sceptics (literally “suspenders-of-judgement”). All those who make assertions about things insofar as they are apprehensible are dogmatists; all of those who suspend judgement about things taking them to be inapprehensible are sceptics.
Sextus offers a longer version, but it is worth quoting it in full:
Τοῖς ζητοῦσί τι πρᾶγμα ἢ εὕρεσιν ἐπακολουθεῖν εἰκὸς ἢ ἄρνησιν εὑρέσεως καὶ ἀκαταληψίας ὁμολογίαν ἢ ἐπιμονὴν ζητήσεως. διόπερ ἴσως καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν κατὰ φιλοσοφίαν ζητουμένων οἱ μὲν εὑρηκέναι τὸ ἀληθὲς ἔφασαν, οἱ δ᾿ ἀπεφήναντο μὴ δυνατὸν εἶναι τοῦτο καταληφθῆναι, οἱ δὲ ἔτι ζητοῦσιν. καὶ εὑρηκέναι μὲν δοκοῦσιν οἱ ἰδίως καλούμενοι δογματικοί, οἷον οἱ περὶ Ἀριστοτέλην καὶ Ἐπίκουρον καὶ τοὺς στωικοὺς καὶ ἄλλοι τινές, ὡς δὲ περὶ ἀκαταλήπτων ἀπεφήναντο οἱ περὶ Κλειτόμαχον καὶ Καρνεάδην καὶ ἄλλοι Ἀκαδημαϊκοί, ζητοῦσι δὲ οἱ σκεπτικοί. ὅθεν εὐλόγως δοκοῦσιν αἱ ἀνωτάτω φιλοσοφίαι τρεῖς εἶναι, δογματικὴ Ἀκαδημαϊκὴ σκεπτική.

In a recent article (“an article from 2001”?) Gisela Striker suggests that the division in Sextus Empiricus improves on an earlier version like what we find in Diogenes laertius. 

## Striker’s reasons?

### ὡς?

### ἀκαταλήπτων?

## How do the two divisions compare?
