# Notes on the trial

## Procedural outline

* A prosecutor first issued a formal summons, in speech or in writing (?). This
  summons (i) stated the charge and (ii) required the defendant to appear on
  a set day before a relevant magistrate. (The magistrate would vary by crime.)
* In the case of the trial of Socrates, the relevant magistrate was the
  king-archon (ἄρχων βασιλεύς), who presided over homicide cases and cases of
  impiety. (What else did the king-archon preside over?)
* The prosecutor had to give at least four days between the notification and the
  appearance before the magistrate. In addition, the prosecutor had to deliver
  the summons to the defendant personally, in front of witnesses. (If you
  couldn’t find the defendant, it was apparently allowed to just read out the
  summons in front of the person’s house, but this was apparently unusual or
  a later practice.) The prosecutor did not have to notify the judge of the day
  just the defendant.
* The defendant was not obligated to appear with the prosecutor before the
  king-archon. However, if the defendant did not appear, the case was guaranteed
  to go forward.
* A citizen could almost always go into voluntary exile legally. (Nails mentions
  only parricide as an exception.)
* If the defendant appears before the king-archon, they enter a plea at the
  preliminary hearing. (TODO: What else happens during the preliminary hearing?)

## Historical background

* Nails claims that there “in 399 [there] was a wave of religious fundamentalism
  that brought with it a steep rise in the number of impiety cases in Athenian
  courts” (5).
