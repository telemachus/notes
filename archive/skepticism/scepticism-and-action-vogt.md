# Scepticism and action
(Katja Maria Vogt, in *The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Scepticism*, ed. Richard Bett; CUP, Cambridge, 2010, 165-180)

> If the sceptic holds nothing to be true, his dogmatic opponent argues, he is not able to act. This is the core of the famous Apraxia challenge, arguably the best known anti-sceptical argument in antiquity (165).

Thus, Vogt begins her essay. She adds that there are several versions of the *apraxia* argument and that they tend to rely on “core assumptions of Stoic epistemology and theory of action” (165). Among such assumptions, Vogt lists (1) impressions (*phantasiai*), some of which are practical, i.e. action prescribing; that we assent to impressions or not voluntarily; that, for most people, assent to an impression is an opinion, and that, for a wise person, assent to an impression is knowledge; that for practical impressions, assent (*sunkatathesis*) is also identified with impulse (*hormê*) and thus leads to action, unless there is some external blocker.

Although the sceptics explanations of their actions focus on the *apraxia* challenge, particularly on assent, belief, and truth, our understanding of their response ramifies outward. Vogt mentions the following additional questions:

+ How normal is a sceptic’s life? Are the actions of a sceptic really like other people’s actions?
+ Does the sceptic consider their life “an attempt at living *well*?” (165, her emphasis). Is suspension of judgment a better route to happiness than (potentially false) beliefs?
+ The sceptics claim to be searchers or investigators, but is this true? “Is sceptical investigations *genuine* investigation?” (165, her emphasis).

My sections and sub-sections follow Vogt’s.

## The Apraxia Challenge: Objections and Replies

### Versions of the Apraxia Challenge

There exist several versions of the *apraxia* argument, and each version can receive multiple replies. Vogt offers the following list, where names in square brackets indicate particularly important replies. The list is not meant to be complete.

+ Self-destruction charge: suspension of judgment leads to self-destruction [Pyrrho]
+ Animal charge: Action without assent is not the action of a rational being; at best it is the behavior of a non-rational animal [Academics]
+ Plant charge: Without assent, the sceptic is reduced to complete, i.e. plant-like, inactivity
+ Inconsistency charge: No matter what the sceptic says, he at least sometimes assents [Sextus]
+ Paralysis charge: Without a practical criterion, the sceptic may not be able to choose one particular course of action. There is no way to settle on any of of several, mutually incompatible actions available at a given time [Academics and Sextus]
+ Eudaimonist charge: The sceptic cannot live a good life [Academics and Sextus]
+ Search charge: The sceptics claim to engage in endless investigation or searching (*skeptein*). However, on dogmatic assumptions, this may seem impossible. If the skeptics assent to nothing, how do they even understand the questions that they investigate? For both the Stoics and the Epicureans, genuine understanding requires “mastering a certain amount of content” (176). How can they do this, if they suspend judgment about everything? (**NB**: Vogt only raises this charge later in the article (on pages 175-177).)

### The sceptic’s options

There is considerable disagreement about how to interpret what the sceptic says in reply to such arguments. Most people agree that the sceptical procedure is dialectical in some sense, but there is no consensus on what this dialectic amounts to or how we should understand it. Vogt mentions several possibilities. First, sceptical arguments might be narrowly dialectical, responding only to specific dogmatic arguments in a narrow context. They would be *ad hominem* in a virtuous sense in this case. Second, we might believe that the sceptic is developing a personal philosophy via dialectical engagement with a dogmatist. Third, perhaps the sceptic is committed to the use of reason, but in a quasi-Socratic manner: the sceptic’s use of reason amounts to “investigating the philosophical theories of *others*” (167, her emphasis).

However that may be, Vogt claims that the sceptics engage at least two elements of Stoic action theory. First, they consider closely what assent actionally is, how it occurs, and whether it is necessary for action. Second, they investigate the type of impression that action requires. By doing this, sceptics can “formulate a so-called practical criterion” (167).

## Academic Responses to the Apraxia Challenge

### Arcesilaus: action without assent

Arcesilaus responds by considering three distinct “movements in the soul” (167), according to the Stoics: impression, assent, and impulse. He argues that according to Stoic assumptions, we can avoid assent and still act. In addition, we *cannot* avoid impression and impulse. They occur without our “performing a cognitive act” (168), and they can impel us to action without a voluntary assent.

The Stoic response is effectively the animal charge from above. Arcesilaus robs us of a core feature of our humanity: our voluntary, rational assent. In addition, however, we can consider the Stoic response as pointing towards the eudaimonist charge. After all, the Stoics might argue, if our actions merely take off from our impressions, then it doesn’t look like we are making the kinds of choices necessary for a good life, as opposed to just whatever life we end up with.

In response, Arcesilaus argues that a person can suspend judgment universally but still guide their actions in accordance with what is reasonable. Vogt notes that this response is doubly hard to interpret. First, what does Arcesilaus mean by “the reasonable”? Second, if a person acts in accordance with what is reasonable, is this not (some form of?) assent?

### The reasonable I: reasonable impressions

Arcesilaus may be appealing to a particular Stoic use of the term *eulogon* or “reasonable”. Stoics distinguish several kinds of *axiomata*, “statements” or “the linguistic counterparts of impressions” (168). One of these is the *eulogon*, and this term applies to statements that “have a greater tendency to be true than they have not to be true” (168). Vogt gives the example “I will be alive tomorrow” (168). We are in no position to *know* that this will be true, but it is more likely to be true than false. Nevertheless a Stoic sage cannot assent to such a statement outright since it may turn out false rather than true.

If this is what Arcesilaus means by “reasonable”, then according to Vogt he uses his practical criterion (the reasonable) to answer the paralysis charge. When choosing between actions, a sceptic can choose the reasonable alternative without assent—and thus without opinion or *dogma*. The sceptic is not left hopeless nor does the sceptic need to choose at random. The sceptic is neither a robot—merely responding mechanically to stimuli—nor a wanton—doing whatever appears before them for any reason whatsoever. They follow a kind of rule or procedure, and it is one with a Stoic pedigree to boot.

### The reasonable II: reasonable justifications

However, Arcesilaus may have in mind a different sense of *eulogon*, a sense that is more specifically ethical. The Stoics define an appropriate action as one that can receive, after the fact, a reasonable (*eulogon*) justification. Both sages and non-sages can perform appropriate actions, but only sages act correctly. So correct action is somehow more or better than appropriate action. Scholars disagree about how to interpret reasonable action and its distinction from appropriate action. The more popular view is that the reasonable justification of an appropriate action is a “more-or-less reasonable” justification. That is, the justification itself for such an action is lacking. Tad Brennan, however, argues that an appropriate action can receive a “genuinely *well*-reasoned justification” (169, her emphasis), but (i) the justification is *ex post facto* and (ii) not necessarily the agent’s own justification. (Vogt seems to favor this second view, but she doesn’t make a point of that here.)

It remains difficult to decide if Arcesilaus intends this sense of reasonable in his argument. On the one hand, he would certainly have known about this use of the term. In addition, this use of the term is very helpful if Arcesilaus responds to the eudaimonist challenge. However, “Arcesilaus seems to be primarily concerned with...practical criteria. An *ex post facto* justification cannot play the role of a criterion” (169). Vogt ends by allowing that Arcesilaus may allude to both Stoic notions while exploiting different aspects of the one word. It would then be up to the Stoic to clean up their terminological mess.

### Carneades’ criterion: the persuasive

Carneades offers the persuasive as his criterion. The Stoics use the word “persuasive” to refer to the psychological effect of impressions, and Vogt thinks that Carneades does as wel. The Stoics argue that impressions can be more or less persuasive, some even “pulling us towards assent” (170). Carneades offers a somewhat complex story of how we can use the persuasive: if an impression is (i) persuasive, (ii) undiverted (not blocked or challenged by another impression), and fully considered, then we can safely follow it, even in “weighty matters of happiness”. As Vogt notes, all of this seemed aimed at answering both the paralysis charge and the eudaimonist charge.

### Approval versus assent

If sceptics regulate or guides their lives in accordance with reasonable or persuasive impressions, how is this not assent? In other words, won’t it come to seem that they are sceptics in name only or that they have smuggled into their accounts action that they haven’t earned? (Vogt first raised this concern in the second section on Arcesilaus’s use of reasonable.) We don’t have any explicit evidence for how Arcesilaus would respond to such a charge, but we do for Carneades.

According to Carneades we can distinguish between “following” or “approving of” an impression on the one hand and assenting to it on the other. Sceptics will never assent, but they can follow or approve of impressions. Scholars, however, disagree a great deal over how to understand Carneades’s distinction.[^1] Without going too far into this question, Vogt insists only that the Academics do not argue for “a ‘rationally blind’ way of being active; their actions are guided by conscious engagement with impressions” (171). As such, the Academic responses respond to the paralysis charge—they can choose between multiple conflicting impressions—and to the animal charge—the Academic accounts makes possible “action for which the agent assumes responsibility, and which she ascribes to her own, rational decision-making” (171). Vogt doesn’t say, however, how precisely the Academics can maintain this delicate balancing act.

## Sextus Empiricus (Pyrrhonian responses)

### Actions or activity?

Sextus offers a more limited response than the Academics. Whereas the Academic sceptics seem to want to maintain a fairly robust sense of agency and responsibility in their actions, Sextus focuses merely on activity. Vogt puts this by saying that the Academics claim that the sceptic can *act*, but Sextus only argues that the sceptic *is active*. While the Academics take up the animal charge, Sextus focuses on the plant charge. “Sextus’ sceptic is *active*, but he is not *acting* in the robust sense of the dogmatist’s theory of human action” (171, her emphases).

However, Sextus does not reply *only* to the plant charge. He mentions two criticisms from opponents (at *M* XI 162-166): inactivity and inconsistency. Inactivity is the plant charge, but inconsistency seems to be the paralysis charge: “the problem how the sceptic can discriminate between various alternative actions, so as to perform *one particular* action, rather than being pulled towards several actions at once” (172). The particular example is a tyrant presenting someone with a “command to do something unspeakable” (172). In such a case, there is a stark choice. Even where Sextus does not explicitly mention inconsistency or the paralysis charge, Vogt argues that Sextus still has the paralysis charge in mind insofar as Sextus talks about a practical criterion “according to which [a sceptic] can perform some actions and abstain from others” (172).

### Appearances

Sextus offers appearance (*to phainomenon*) as the practical criterion of Pyrrhonism (*PH* I 21-22). However, Vogt immediately raises a problem for Sextus: his answer seems to make him vulnerable to the paralysis charge.

> Would it not seem, in particular from the sceptic’s *own* point of view, that there are regularly several conflicting appearances? The attempt to act on all of them would indeed seem paralysing (172).

In order to address this vulnerability, Vogt takes a closer look at Sextus’s use of words for “appearance”.[^2] Vogt picks out several distinct—though related—ways in which Sextus uses words from the *phain* root:

1. Sextus defines scepticism as the ability to create oppositions (and eventually *isosthenia* by opposing (i) thoughts with thoughts, (ii) appearances (*phainomena*) with appearances, and (iii) thoughts with appearances (*PH* I 8-9). In this case, Vogt argues that *phainomena* is equivalent to perception (*aisthêta*).
1. As a matter of how the sceptic speaks, Sextus says hat he uses the cognate verb (*phainesthai*) elliptically: “x now appears F to me” instead of “x now appears [to be] F to me”. Such an appearance is an affection (*pathos*) of the sceptics, “something [they] passively [undergo]” (173). Vogt adds that such appearances are not limited to perceptual appearances.
1. When he discusses sceptical action, Sextus defines *phainomenon* as co-extensive with *phantasia* (impression), and he says that impressions are involuntary affections (*pathê*).

Like the Stoics, Sextus allows that some appearnces can be practical and some are not. In order to focus on the practical ones and give an account of a specifically practical criterion, Sextus uses the idea of “ordinary observance (of life)” (*biôtikê têrêsis*). He sub-divides these ordinary observances into four categories:

1. Guidance by nature: our natural human capacities for perception and thought[^3]
1. Necessitation by affection: things like hunger and thirst drive us to act
1. The handing down of laws and customs: sceptics can regard “piety as good and impiety as bad” in an everyday way because of how they were raised
1. Instruction in areas of expertise: in a manner similar to laws and customs, sceptics can become proficient in trades or practices through instruction

Vogt considers these ordinary ways of life especially helpful for narrowing down sceptical appearances. “Not every passively experienced impression guides the sceptic’s actions. Rather, only those passively experienced impressions that go along with an ordinary way of leading one’s life do so. Thus, appearances can do the work of a practical *criterion*” (174, her emphasis). Vogt seems especially concerned with the paralysis charge here, though she doesn’t say so explicitly.

### Necessitation of the affections, customs, and training

Sextus associates necessitation of affections at various points with forced assent (*PH* I 13, I 19, I 29-30, I 193, I 237-238). This can seem intuitive: hunger impels us, it may seem. Vogt notes that Sextus does use the word “assent” (rather than “adhere”), at least sometimes. However, this is not inconsistent with suspension of judgment for two reasons. First, assent is only assent to an appearance.[^4] This point applies to all sceptic uses of appearance as a criterion. Second, “the sceptic’s assent is *forced*” (174, her emphasis). This point applies specifically to this part of Sextus’s account. Not all appearances are (necessarily?) forced. When he describes an “assent” as “forced”, Sextus abuses the very Stoic concepts he employs. For the Stoics, “forced assent” is an oxymoron; it is essential to assent that it is “in our power” (174).

According to Vogt, when the sceptics follow the norms of their communities or their training, they do so without “adopting...or endorsing these values”. The way in which a sceptic follows such norms is essentially passive. “Custom and training explain why the sceptic does some things, but not others (thus responding to the Paralysis charge)” (174). Vogt adds that Sextus describes (some?) sceptical actions as “by chance”, but she interprets this in a particular way. These actions are not random, not “mere chance to this rather than to that impression”. It’s chance “in the sense that it just happens to be the case that [they were] raised and trained in this way rather than in that way” (174-175). Returning to the tyrant example, Vogt says that a sceptic will act according to the ideas their parents gave them, and which ideas those are is a matter of chance.[^5]

This account, according to Vogt, can save Sextus from both the inconsistency charge and the paralysis charge. As I mentioned above, there won’t be any parlysis since the sceptics will incline one way rather than another, according to their upbringing, training, and so forth. But there is no inconsistency, because when the sceptics incline this way or that way, they do so without any dogmatic assent involving believing things to be true, real, valuable, and so forth.

In a later passage (*PH* II 202) Sextus describes something as involving “assent without belief” (ἀδοξάστως συγκατατιθέμενοι)[^6]. Like the earlier idea of a “forced assent”, this is an abuse of Stoic terminology. For a Stoic, assent necessarily involves belief. Stoics do not believe that the two can be taken apart in this way.

### Nature’s guidance

Vogt believes that the first of Sextus’s four everyday observances seems different from the others. As she puts it, “[f]rom the immediate context, it is not clear how this fits in” (175). She raises two questions:

1. “Why is the fact that the sceptic can perceive and think a result of nature’s guidance?” (175).
1. “[W]hy does it need to be explained within the reply to the Apraxia challenge?” (175).

The dogmatists believe that nature gives us the abilities to perceive and to think. Thus, we answer the first question by assuming that Sextus takes up this claim *ad hominem*. According to both Stoics and Epicureans, people naturally acquire reason in childhood. Both schools interpret reason here “in a substantive way...reason means to have acquired so-called preconceptions and thus to have mastered a certain amount of content” (175). (Vogt implicitly contrasts this with a formal or thin sense of reason, according to which it is just the ability to juggle ideas in various fashions.)

We answer the second question by thinking about the search charge. If Sextus needs to explain how sceptics can investigate while still suspending judgment about everything, nature’s guidance will help. Sceptics can understand the questions that they investigate because of the content they acquire naturally in childhood. And their opponents are in no position to deny this since Sextus has taken his ideas about cognitive development directly from them. Thus, sceptics can investigate “for example, whether there is anything good by nature, and...have some understanding of what this question amounts to, without having assented to any assumptions about what the good is, or what nature is” (176).

Although I think that Vogt puts this passage to very clever use, I’m not sure I agree with her that it requires such a complex justification. That is, I don’t deny that Setus might use nature’s guidance to answer the search charge, but I think it makes sense for Sextus to mention nature’s guidance even without considering the search charge. Insofar as Sextus wants to answer the plant and parlysis charges, he needs to establish how we receive information about the world (without, in the relevant sense, opinions). Nature’s guidance answers this problem: we receive a great deal of information passively through the senses and via more formal (in Vogt’s sense) uses of reason (juggling thoughts, making connections by analogy, comparing items, etc.). In a nutshell, I’m not convinced that the first everyday observance seems as out of context as Vogt takes it to be.

### The Pyrrhonian life

Vogt concludes by considering the larger narrative of sceptical life, according to Sextus. Sextus narrates a sceptical life in which a person, disturbed by disagreements, converts to scepticism and “discovers the quietude of suspension of judgement as it were by chance”. Vogt, however, questions two features of Sextus’s account: one question about sceptical investigation and one question about how ordinary a sceptical life really is.

Starting with the second question, Vogt suggests a sense in which Sextus may be right and a sense in which he still seems wrong. As she argues, perhaps we should grant to Sextus that, compared with the odd-bird Stoics, the sceptics seem to lead ordinary lives, believing rather ordinary things, following customs and training, not believing ourselves to be robustly responsible agents, and lacking firm moral commitment to our views and behavior. So far, so good for Sextus. However, even if we grant all this, the sceptics themselves are still quite odd birds too. As Vogt says “only people who are troubled by *philosophical questions* would adopt” such a life (178). And in this sense, the sceptics remain quite far from ordinary life and ordinary people. Vogt also points out that the strangeness is not specific to our culture or point of view: Socrates “runs into [this problem] all the time” (178). It requires a great deal of question and answer before people realize that they *should* doubt their “unquestioned assumptions and the many inconsistencies which may lurk in them” (178).

Returning to the first question, Vogt thinks that we should connect what Sextus says about sceptical investigation to “his reply to the Eudaimonist charge” (178). Sextus claims not only that the sceptic life is possible, but that the sceptic “lives ‘correctly’ and thus well (and in a sense, better than everyone else)” (178). How does this work? Well, the sceptical way of life has an account (i.e., the narrative that explains how a person becomes a sceptic and then remains a sceptic while and by investigating). The sceptics can live “correctly” insofar as they live in accordance with such an account. Sextus explicitly says (*PH* I 16-17) that he means “correctly” not with reference to virtue but in a broader sense where it includes suspension of judgment.

This is very nicely argued by Vogt, but a further step confuses me. Thus far, Vogt has shown how Sextus can create space for saying that sceptics live “correctly” insofar as they follow a certain story or account. So far, so good. However, Vogt concludes thus:

> An explanation of the sceptic’s ability to *think* is, as it were, a first step in giving this account, which eventually, or so we are invited to believe, lays out a *good* way to live (178).

Nothing that she’s said so far convinces me that Sextus has any bridge from “correct” to “good” in this way. I wonder if Vogt herself thinks that Sextus has such a route or if she only means to report what Sextus claims. I suppose we can supply to Sextus the idea that whatever is correct is (insofar as correct) good, but the idea of correctness as “living in accordance with a story that contains quite a lot of chance” seems to me too thin to do this work.

[^1]: Vogt briefly mentions two views. According to Frede a sceptic can “have a view” that guides action without thereby “taking a position” (170). According to Bett, the sceptics can “question the plausibility of the Stoic assumption that, in everything we do, we judge things to be so-and-so” (170).

[^2]: Before she does this, however, she briefly argues that Pyrrho had already used “appearances” in some of the same ways that Sextus does. However, this is brief, speculative, and not a necessary part of her larger account.

[^3]: Frede sees this as the sceptics making room for reason in human nature, but Striker limits it to less advanced thought and language. Vogt doesn’t dig into detail here.

[^4]: Vogt doesn’t say why this matters. Presumably, on a Stoic account, assent to an appearance doesn’t count as a commitment to the truth of any matter.

[^5]: Compare Montaigne, Descartes, and Montesquieu on customs and ways of life.

[^6]: Vogt translate this phrase “undogmatic assent”, which might be tendentious.
