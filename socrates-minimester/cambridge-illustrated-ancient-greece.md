# The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece, ed. Paul Cartledge

## Introduction, Paul Cartledge

Cartledge—hereafter C—acknowledges that the ancient Greeks were remarkable and
central to later European culture and history, but he also says that this book
wants to “set that undoubted glory firmly in its proper historical perspective,
in its widest context, even at the cost of tarnishing it more the halo a little
(x). He also says that they want to look at rural Greece more closely than than
most books do.

### The Greek Alphabet

Now that we understand Linear B, we can see Greek culture as far back as the
1500s BCE. There are clay tablets with archival records in Pylos, Tiryns, and
Mycenae (Peloponnese), Thebes (central Greece), and Chania and Cnossos (Crete).
There are also oil-jars with Linear B on them.
