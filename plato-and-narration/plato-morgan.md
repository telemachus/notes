# “Plato” K. A. Morgan, in Narrators, Narratees, and Narratives in Ancient Greek Literature

Despite appearances, we should include Plato in a survey of ancient Greek
narrative.  Yes, most of his works are dialogues—at least at first glance.
And, yes, many narratologists quote Plato’s *Republic* to distinguish between
narrative and *mimesis*.  And, finally, yes, Diogenes Laertius says that some
ancient readers distinguished between “dramatic,” “narrative,” and “mixed”
dialogues (3.50; the Greek terms are δραματικούς, διηγηματικούς, and μικτούς).
But none of these considerations is decisive.

First, I’ll summarize Morgan on the second and third points.  Narratologists,
and others, are wrong to distinguish between “narrative” and “*mimesis*” in
*Republic* III.  In that passage, Socrates argues that everything poets write
is (a kind of) narrative (διήγησις).  Socrates distinguishes “simple (or pure)
narrative” (ἁπλής διήγησις), “narrative through imitiation” (διήγησις διὰ
μιμήσεως), and “mixed narrative” (διήγησις διὰ ἀμφοτέρων).  Note, however,
that all three of these are forms of narrative.  For Socrates, and presumably
Plato, drama is a type of narrative, not something opposed to narrative.[^1]
