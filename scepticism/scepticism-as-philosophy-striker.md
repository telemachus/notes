# Scepticism as a Kind of Philosophy, by Gisela Stiker
(Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie 83, 2001, 113-129)

## Introduction

Scepticism, in several forms, is a standard problem for modern epistemology. Most broadly, some sceptics deny that knowledge is possible. In addition there are specific forms of scepticism, such as Descartes’s doubts concerning an external world, or moral scepticism, such as Mackie’s or Williams’s. In all these cases, sceptics are radical doubters: they “call into question assumputions that are usually taken for granted by ordinary people as well as by other philosophers” (113). Anti-sceptical philosophers believe that they must refute these doubts and show that they are unjustified. (Left unstated is the implication that if such philosophers cannot refute these doubts, then the positive claims of non-sceptics are themselves implicitly unjustified.)

Ancient scepticism is different. The key feature of ancient sceptics was not this or that doctrine—they had none—but rather an action: suspension of judgement. Sceptics do not make any judgements or assertions; they do not consider any question settled well enough to merit a judgement or assertion. Instead, they are “still investigating” (PH 1.4). Thus Sextus distinguishes scepticism from other philosophical schools by its “attitude to philosophical problems and theses” (114); and he would consider modern sceptics to be negative dogmatists, just as he classifies the Academics. Such people “argue for the view that knowledge is impossible on the basis of specific assumptions about what knowledge would have to be” (114).

Striker proposes “to take a look at Sextus’ claim that Scepticism is not a doctrine at all, but rather a different kind of philosophy” (114). As the essay goes on, however, Striker also asks whether Pyrrhonian scepticism should count (by our lights) as *any* kind of philosophy. If it turns out, as it might, that they are uninterested in discovering the truth or proceeding in accordance with rules of rationality, then we might not consider them philosophers at all, regardless of what they think.

On a side note, Striker compares the three-part division of philosophers with a “simpler two-fold division” (114) from Diogenes Laertius:
> Τῶν δὲ φιλοσόφων οἱ μὲν γεγόνασι δογματικοί, οἱ δ᾽ ἐφεκτικοί· δογματικοὶ μὲν ὅσοι περὶ τῶν πραγμάτων ἀποφαίνονται ὡς καταληπτῶν· ἐφεκτικοὶ δὲ ὅσοι ἐπέχουσι περὶ αὐτῶν ὡς ἀκαταλήπτων (I 16).
> Some philosophers have been dogmatic, and others ephetics. The dogmatic are those who make assertions about things, taking them to be apprehensible; the ephetics are those who suspend judgement about things, taking them to be inapprehensible.
Stiker objects that ὡς καταληπτῶν implies that the “ephetics” “maintain that things cannot be known”, but Diogenes does not say nor imply this. It is true that, for example, Smyth explains this use of ὡς in the following way: “ὡς often indicates the thought or the assertion of the subject of the principal verb or of some other person prominent in the sentence” (§2996). Goodwin says similarly “[participles with ὡς] express the idea or the assertion of the subject of the leading verb or that of some other person prominent in the sentence, *without implying* that it is also the idea of the speaker or writer” (§1574). The key point here is that ὡς attributes the thought or speech to someone, usually the subject, in the sentence at issue. The use of ὡς by itself does not necessarily signal committment of any special, philosophically precise kind.

Hence, we can read Diogenes more charitably than Striker does. On such a charitable reading, Diogenes says simply that the ephetics suspend belief insofar as they take things to be inapprehensible. But careful ephetics can still insist that when they “take things” to be thus-or-so, they mean only non-veridical or non-belief-like appearances.
