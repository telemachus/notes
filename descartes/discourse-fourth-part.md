# Notes on *Discours de la méthode, quartième partie*

## Paragraph 1

Although Descartes worries that some people will find his metaphysical meditations weird, he also feels compelled to share them in order that readers can judge the foundations of his system.

He begins by comparing practical and theoretical concerns. (These terms are mine not his.) In the case of morals, we must often make due with merely probable beliefs, and we must treat them as certain. In the case of the pursuit of truth, however, Descartes decided to do entirely the opposite: he would treat everything that was not certain as positively false. His goal was to see whether anything remained. If anything does survive this onslaught of doubt, then it will be "entirely indubitable."

Descartes then proceeds rapidly through a series of increasingly wide stages of doubt. First, he doubts all sensory perceptions because the senses sometimes deceive us. Second, he doubts the truths of mathematics and logic because (i) people sometimes make mistakes on very simple matters in these areas and (ii) Descartes thinks that he is no better than anyone else. Third, he will "feign" that everything that strikes him when he is awake is no more true than the illusions of his dreams because anything he can think when awake, he can think while asleep without its being true at all.

Despite all this doubt, Descartes runs into a solid truth at this point: "while I was wishing thus to think that everything was false, it necessarily had to be that I, who was thinking this, was something." This in turn leads to "je pense, donc je suis," which Descartes asserts to be "so firm and so assured that even the most extravagant suppositions of the skeptics cannot weaken it." Descartes therefore accepts this truth as the first principle of his philosophy.

Descartes doesn't say so, but thinking both is and is not special in this argument. It is not special insofar as "if X (actually) does Y, then X exists" is probably a general truth. It is special insofar as "thinking" is self-affirming. If I think that I am thinking, then I am thinking, but I can think I'm walking, cooking, or many other things that I am not actually doing. So it matters that Descartes picks "thinking" as the action for his argument.

## Paragraph 2

Now that Descartes has established *that he exists*, he wishes to understand *what he is*. He begins with two observations:
1. He can feign (*feindre*) that he has no body, that there is not any external world, and that there is no place where he is, but he cannot feign, as far as this goes (pour cela) that he does not at all exist; just the opposite: from the very fact that he thinks of doubting other matters, it very evidently and very certainly follows that he exists.
1. On the other hand, if he had stopped thinking, even if everything else he had ever imagined had been true, he would have no reason to think that he existed.

In order to understand these observations, I think we must take them both in the context of the universal doubt that Descartes initiates in the first paragraph. Thus, when Descartes speaks (twice) of "feigning" in the first observation, he does *not* have in mind a thought experiment. He isn't imagining that he has no body in order to consider various logical possibilities, in the manner of a contemporary philosopher. Instead, he is currently engaged in a doubt so hyperbolic that it is tantamount to simulation. He is forcing himself not to believe things so basic that he calls this doubt pretend.[^1]

With that in mind, what Descartes asks in this paragraph is this: given that I have placed so much in doubt, and given that I can be sure I exist, what do I have reason to believe about this I that thinks?

[^1]: For example, in the first paragraph, "je me résolus de feindre que toutes les choses qui m'étaient jamais entrées en l'espirit n'étaient non plus vraies que les illusions de mes songes."
