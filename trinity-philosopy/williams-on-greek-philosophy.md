## The Birth of Metaphysics

Williams considers Parmenides to mark a profound shift and to provide "the first example of pure metaphysical reasoning" (219). He adds that "it remains one of the most ambitious" (219). What is new about Parmenides' project is that he attempts "to determine the basic nature of reality entirely by argument from premisses self-evident to reflection" (219).

The core premiss concerns being and non-being: "it is, and it cannot be that it is not" (219). Parmenides rules out from the start any thought—or any inquiry relying on a thought—that "it is not" because of an alleged parallelism between thinking about something and that something's existence. Since what is not is nothing, it "is not available, so to speak, for thought" (220).

Scholars disagree about how Parmenides defended this view, but Williams sees a "primitive notion" (220) at the heart of Parmenides' arguments. According to Williams, Parmenides relies upon a conception "language and thought having a content only because they touch or are in contact with what is" (220). If this is right, it helps us see why Parmenides would reject thought of what is not: you can't make the requisite contact with it. Of course we might wonder why Parmenides believed that *all* thinking was like touching or literal grasping. (NB: Williams doesn't mention this one way or another, but I don't think that such a view of thought is at all inherent in Greek language about thought or thinking.)

Regardless of how he gets there, Parmenides clearly rejects non-being, and this rejection leads to radical consequences in Parmenides' mind. 

+ What is cannot have a beginning or an end.
+ What is is singular, continuous, without division, and unique.

For Williams the singularity of what is means that "the question of what 'it' is lapses" (221). There's no longer any sense in wondering what 'it' is in statements about what is: "It is just that thing, whatever it is, that we are thinking and speaking of, when we succeed in thinking and speaking of something" (221). Williams adds that Parmenides certainly believes that we *can* succeed in thinking and speaking about something, but he believes that it is equally certain that "it is not what, in our everyday error, we take ourselves to be thinking and speaking" about (221).

Williams draws out some of the clear connections between Parmenides' ideas and those of Plato. Plato's forms are eternal, unchanging, and uncreated; they participate fully in being and are only vaguely felt in the world of becoming. Plato, however, made more concessions than Parmenides to the world as we know it. He admits a plurality of forms, and he grants more to becoming than Parmenides did. Plato attempted to distinguish different senses of "is not", according to Williams, in order to break through some of the difficulties that Parmenides' legacy presented.

Williams also touches briefly on the importance of Zeno's paradoxes, which were the children, so to speak, of Parmenides' arguments against plurality and change. In order to address the paradoxes, later mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers were forced to develop much more sophisticated ideas of continuum, limit, movement, change, and void. Thus, Parmenides' negative metaphysical pronouncements led indirectly to a great deal of progress in related disciplines.
