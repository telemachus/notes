## Introduction

> I happen to agree with Socrates and Glaucon that philosophy is a yearning for and seeking of Truth of a very particular kind (*Republic* 5.475e), but we cannot reach the universal except by way of particulars; there is no unmediated apprehension of the fundamental principle of the all (xxxviii).

### Calendars

The Athenians used three calendars in the 5th and 4th centuries. The lunar calendar had twelve months of 29 or 30 days. This gives a calendar of 353-355 days. To make this lunar calendar agree with the solar year, an official would add an extra month sometimes, creating a calendar of 383-385 days. There was also a festival calendar, and a calendar that tracked terms in the Council (βουλή, *boulē*). A date like 407/406 means that we can’t tell whether the event is in *our* calendar year of 407 or 406.
