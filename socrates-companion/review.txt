Although it enters an already crowded field, this new companion to Socrates
will be very welcome to scholars. In the words of the editors, the book
aims "to assemble a comprehensive guide to the main issues engaged in the
philosophy of Socrates" (vi), and these essays fulfill that aim admirably.
The writing throughout is clear, and although the topics of the essays are
generally narrow, the coverage is very deep. I will first say how this
volume compares to the two other companions to Socrates already in print
and then discuss individual chapters. At the end, I will provide a list of
editorial considerations and errata.

Despite obvious overlap, each of the three companions to Socrates has its
own particular strength. Blackwell's <i>A Companion to Socrates</i>[[1]]
has the broadest range of viewpoints and topics. Its authors are not all
philosophers or Classicists, and it includes essays on subjects such as
Socrates in art, in Arabic philosophy, in the Renaissance and in relation
to psychoanalysis and modern education. <i>The Cambridge Companion to
Socrates</i>[[2]] and the companion under review here are both similar in
topics and approach. In fact, eight topics and two authors appear in both
volumes. However, they still differ greatly in audience. The Cambridge
companion is well-suited to undergraduates or general readers seeking
a clear, brief introduction to central topics in the philosophy of
Socrates. The volume under review here, on the other hand, provides a far
deeper look at the last 25 to 30 years of scholarship on each topic. These
reviews of the literature are detailed: it's not uncommon for an author to
go through four or more variant solutions to a puzzle, all similar but with
subtle distinctions. As a result, the Bloomsbury companion would likely
overwhelm less experienced readers. Scholars and graduate students,
however, will be glad to have this kind of comprehensive coverage of
central Socratic topics, all in one place.

Robin Waterfield opens the book by reviewing the evidence for the
historical figure of Socrates. He makes a forceful case for extreme
scepticism: none of the witnesses can be trusted whether alone or in
combinations. Surprisingly, Waterfield himself still attempts to
reconstruct a picture of the historical Socrates at the end of his essay.
I find his positive conclusions less convincing than his sceptical
arguments, but they do testify to how badly we all seem to want the true
Socrates.

Iakovos Vasiliou begins his chapter on Socratic irony with what he calls
play. Play is that feature of Plato's Socrates that <i>forces</i> readers
to wonder if Socrates is serious. Vasiliou contrasts this playfulness with
most philosophical writing. As he says, no one asks whether Aristotle or
Kant is serious. It barely makes sense even to ask that about such authors.
What this suggests to me, though Vasiliou doesn't put it quite this way, is
that philosophical readers of Plato who ignore the play are being
intellectually dishonest. They cannot simply claim that they care only
about truth and the arguments, since if they ignore the play, they are
likely not even to know what Socrates actually claims.

David Wolfsdorf's essay considers Socratic methodology, broadly speaking,
with a particular focus on the elenchus. Unlike all the other
contributions, this chapter is completely devoted to reviewing other
scholarship and it proceeds temporally, article by article, through 21
articles. Although at the very end, Wolfsdorf suggests possible paths for
future research, he offers effectively no views of his own. He summarizes
only. Wolfsdorf intends this to preserve "the integrity" of other views
and to illustrate "their dialectical engagement within" this topic (35).
Unfortunately, I think the experiment is a failure. The result is very dry
reading and does not seem to me to help the reader significantly.

William Prior convincingly argues that Socrates has a metaphysics. He
should not be viewed only as a moral thinker, as Vlastos and others argue.
Using evidence from <i>Euthyphro</i> and <i>Hippias Major</i>, Prior
demonstrates that the Socratic pursuit of definitions relies on a theory of
forms that resembles the more famous Platonic theory in numerous respects.
As such, Prior also argues for continuity between the early and middle
dialogues in this regard.

Keith McPartland carefully charts the diverse interpretations of Socratic
ignorance. He also takes seriously Socrates' occasional avowals of
knowledge as well as the surprising confidence (even arrogance) that
Socrates has in his own opinions. McPartland favors an interpretation that
Socrates distinguishes between an extraordinarily strong cognitive state
that he lacks and more everyday knowledge that he possesses. Although
I agree that this can be a logically consistent position, I'm less
convinced that it can be psychologically stable. Socrates insists that the
superhuman cognitive state is <i>essential</i> for happiness
(<i>eudaimonia</i>) and that he (and everyone he has ever met) fails to
reach this state. Why does that not eat away at his arrogance? Why does
that not open up sceptical doubts about even the true beliefs that he
possesses "based on a warrant sufficient for unhedged assertion and full
confidence" (135)? (I view this more as a lingering problem about Socrates
than a criticism of McPartland's essay.)

Hugh H. Benson makes a strong case that Socrates is committed to a principle
of priority of definition. Roughly: If someone fails to know what F is,
then that person fails to know anything about F. Even more interestingly,
however, Benson argues that many recent denials of this are based far more
on contemporary philosophical concerns than what Socrates says. Benson
responds to the philosophical concerns by arguing that it is those concerns
that are flawed more than Socrates' commitment to the priority of
definition. In response to Peter Geach's famous claim that "We know heaps
of things without being able to define" terms (quoted on 155), Benson
relies on something like McPartland's strong view of knowledge. He argues
that we may have justified true beliefs about such things, but we don't, in
a Socratic sense, possess knowledge about them.

Naomi Reshotko reviews the Socratic understanding of <i>eudaimonia</i>, the
"central value and supreme goal of a human life" (156). According to
Reshotko, Socrates pursues <i>eudaimonia</i> in a practical rather than
a theoretical manner. This leads her to argue that most commentators are
misguided when they seek necessary and sufficient conditions for
<i>eudaimonia</i> in Socratic arguments. Even more radically, Reshotko
argues that Socrates identifies our ultimate goal as omniscience.[[2]] In
an effort to be happy, we would ideally know literally everything. Reshotko
grants that this goal is impossible, but maintains that "Socrates thought
there was a great deal to be gained by trying" (158). I'm honestly unsure
of what to make of this, but the chapter is challenging and well-worth
reading for more traditional interpreters of Socratic ethics.

In the next chapter, Thomas C. Brickhouse and Nicholas D. Smith provide an
exemplary contrast with Reshotko. While Reshotko tries to argue primarily
from what Socrates (and other characters) say without consideration of
contemporary philosophy, Brickhouse and Smith use philosophical
plausibility to drive their interpretation of Socrates' words.[[3]] In this
examination of Socratic moral psychology, for example, they struggle to
make more room than Reshotko for the psychological force of desire. They do
so explicitly because they believe that their interpretation better handles
"the actual phenomena" (196). The result may seem to some readers like
a very weak or attenuated version of motivational <i>intellectualism</i>.
However, Brickhouse and Smith might reasonably reply that when interpreting
<i>a philosopher</i>, charity demands that we consider truth. In any case,
the contrast between this chapter and Reshotko's is instructive and
interesting beyond the specific disagreements.

Suzanne Obdrzalek reviews the Socratic theory of love, as found primarily
in Plato's <i>Lysis</i>. She begins with an objection by Vlastos that has
been central for later work: Vlastos objects that the Socratic theory is
unduly egoistic and that Socratic does not recognize truly other-regarding
love. Obdrzalek rejects arguments that escape this objection by finding
other-regarding love in the <i>Lysis</i>. Instead, she argues that theories
of other-regarding love are themselves problematic. Although this may seem
like burning down the village in order to save it, Obdrzalek makes serious
criticisms of two modern theories of other-regarding love. In this regard,
her contribution recalls Benson's.

Curtis Johnson suggests that we can solve the disagreement between an
(apparently) liberal or disobedient <i>Apology</i> and an (apparently)
authoritarian <i>Crito</i> by interpreting <i>Apology</i> as more
authoritarian than it initially seems. (This is a minority view. Most
readers try to make <i>Crito</i> more liberal instead.) However, he also
suggests that, in addition to following the commands of human or divine
superiors, Socrates will also follow the argument (<i>logos</i>) that seems
best to him on each occasion. I worry that this opens up a huge potential
gap where anything might go, especially given Socrates' generally negative
views of human cognitive achievement.

At the end of his chapter on Socratic theology and piety, Mark McPherran
examines the formal accusations of impiety made against Socrates. In
a previous section McPherran offers an attractive explanation of the
religious views of Socrates, but that explanation has little in common with
what Socrates says in his own defense at trial. Charges of "Why didn't
Socrates just say that?" are tricky, but nevertheless I'm struck by the gap
between what Socrates says on his own behalf and how McPherran explains his
views. Most troublesome is that McPherran says that Socrates was "obliged"
by Meletus to focus on atheism (274 and see also 272), but it was Socrates
who led Meletus to atheism in the first place.

Using a four-part taxonomy of <i>mania</i> from Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i>,
John Bussanich categorizes and examines the various religious experiences
of Socrates. The chapter is necessarily highly speculative, and it wasn't
clear to me whether Bussanich intended his remarks to apply to Socrates the
person or the character of the same name in the writings of Plato and
Xenophon.

Rather than a purely political or purely religious motivation, Mark
Ralkowski argues for a mixed-motivation explanation of the trial and
conviction of Socrates. Socrates was certainly anti-democratic, but that
doesn't mean that he was pro-oligarchy. Instead he was an idealist.
Nevertheless, his anti-democratic statements might easily lead the city and
the jury to find him threatening, especially given the political climate of
399. In addition, the religious <i>was</i> political to the ancient
Athenians. Socrates' private <i>daimonion</i> would have set him apart from
the rest of the city in a threatening manner.

[[2]] This is my word rather than Reshotko's, but I feel that it's fair.
Reshotko says more than once that Socrates views the knowledge essential to
<i>eudaimonia</i> to cover <i>everything</i>. As she puts it, "Socrates
thought all knowledge equally important and an equal factor in virtue so
that the completely and truly virtuous person is the one who has all of
every kind of knowledge" (158).

[[3]] Sophisticated readers may want to deny that it's possible to do one
without a healthy dose of the other, but I don't accept that it's
impossible for one to predominate. I would argue that the clash between
Reshotko and Brickhouse and Smith is evidence that it is possible.
