# *North and South* Elizabeth Gaskell

## Volume I

Mr. Hale and Mr. Thorton have a revealing conversation about the classics.

> "But you have the rudiments of a good education," remarked Mr. Hale.  "The
> quick zest with which you are now reading Homer, shows me that you do not come
> to it as an unknown book: you have read it before, and are only recalling your
> old knowledge."
>
> "That is true,—I had blundered along it at school; I dare say, I was even
> considered a pretty fair classic in those days, though my Latin and Greek have
> slipt away from me since.  But I ask you, what preparation were they for such
> a life as I had to lead?  None at all.  Utterly none at all.  On the point of
> education, any man who can read and write starts fair with me in the amount of
> really useful knowledge that I had at that time."
>
> "Well!  I don’t agree with you.  But there I am perhaps somewhat of a pedant.
> Did not the recollection of the heroic simplicity of the Homeric life nerve
> you up?"
>
> "Not one bit!" exclaimed Mr. Thornton, laughing.  "I was too busy to think
> about any dead people, with the living pressing alongside of me, neck to neck,
> in the struggle for bread.  Now that I have my mother safe in the quiet peace
> that becomes her age, and duly rewards her former exertions, I can turn to all
> that old narration and thoroughly enjoy it."
>
> "I dare say, my remark came from the professional feeling of there being
> nothing like leather," replied Mr. Hale.

After Mr. Thorton and Mr. Hale talk,
Margaret avoids shaking hands with Thorton—for the first but not last time.

> When Mr. Thornton rose up to go away, after shaking hands with Mr. and Mrs.
> Hale, he made an advance to Margaret to wish her good-bye in a similar manner.
> It was the frank familiar custom of the place; but Margaret was not prepared
> for it.
>
> She simply bowed her farewell; although the instant she saw the hand, half put
> out, quickly drawn back, she was sorry she had not been aware of the
> intention.  Mr. Thornton, however, knew nothing of her sorrow, and, drawing
> himself up to his full height, walked off, muttering as he left the house—
>
> "A more proud, disagreeable girl I never saw.  Even her great beauty is
> blotted out of one’s memory by her scornful ways" (85).

Fanny reveals something important about conscience and shame.
She cares too much what others think and not enough about her own conduct.

> 'Mr. Thornton!  Does he really find time to read with a tutor, in the midst of
> all this business,—and this abominable strike in hand as well?'
>
> Fanny was not sure, from Mrs. Slickson's manner, whether she ought to be proud
> of ashamed of her brother's conduct; and, like all people who try and take
> other people's 'ought' for the rule of their feelings, she was included to
> blush for any singularity of action.  Her shame was interrupted by the
> dispersion of the guests (165).

After Margaret protects Mr. Thorton from the strikers, she cannot sleep.
She feels shame, but I am uncertain why or at what.

> She lay down and never stirred.  To move hand or foot, or even so much as one
> finger, would have been an exertion beyond the powers of volition or motion.
> She was so tired, so stunned, that she thought she never slept at all; her
> feverish thoughts passed and repassed the boundary between sleeping and
> waking, and kept their own miserable identity.  She could not be alone,
> prostrate, powerless as she was,—a cloud of faces looked up at her, giving her
> no idea of fierce vivid anger, or of personal danger, but a deep sense of
> shame that she could thus be the object of universal regard—a sense of shame
> so acute that it seemed as if she would fain have burrowed into the earth to
> hide herself, and yet she could not escape out of that unwinking glare of many
> eyes (191-192).

## Volume II

When Margaret and her father talk with Mr. Higgins, the book reveals some of its
thoughts about strikes and wages.

> So they questioned and listened.  The workmen's calculations were based (like
> too many of the masters') on false premises.  They reckoned on their fellow-men
> as if they possessed the calculable powers of machines, no more, no less; no
> allowance for human passions getting the better of reason, as in the case of
> Boucher and the rioters; and believing that the representations of their
> injuries would have the same effect on strangers far away, as the injuries
> (fancied or real) had upon themselves.  They were consequently surprised and
> indignant at the poor Irish, who had allowed themselves to be imported and
> brought over to take their places.  This indignation was tempered, in some
> degree, by contempt for 'them Irishers,' and by pleasure at the idea of the
> bungling way in which they would set to work, and perplex their new masters
> with their ignorance and stupidity, strange exaggerated stories of which were
> already spreading through the town.  But the most cruel cut of all was that of
> the Milton workmen, who had defied and disobeyed the commands of the Union to
> keep the peace, whatever came; who had originated discord in the camp, and
> spread the panic of the of the law being arrayed against them (228).

Higgins tells a pointed story about the owner of a mill trying to teach him
economics.

> Yo' needn't trouble yoursel', sir,' said Nicholas.  'Their book-stuff goes in
> at one ear and out at t'other. I can make nought on't.  Afore Hamper and me had
> this split, th' overlooker telled him I were stirring up the men to ask for
> higher wages; and Hamper met me one day in th' yard. He'd a thin book i' his
> hand, and says he, "Higgins, I'm told you're one of those damned fools that
> think you can get higher wages for asking for 'em; ay, and keep 'em up too,
> when you've forced 'em up.  Now, I'll give yo' a chance and try if yo've any
> sense in yo'.  Here's a book written by a friend o' mine, and if yo'll read it
> yo'll see how wages find their own level, without either masters or men having
> aught to do with them; except the men cut their own throats wi' striking, like
> the confounded noodles they are."  Well, now, sir, I put it to yo', being
> a parson, and having been in th' preaching line, and having had to try and
> bring folk o'er to what yo' thought was a right way o' thinking--did yo' begin
> by calling 'em fools and such like, or didn't yo' rayther give 'em some kind
> words at first, to make 'em ready for to listen and be convinced, if they
> could; and in yo'r preaching, did yo' stop every now and then, and say, half
> to them and half to yo'rsel',  "But yo're such a pack o' fools, that I've
> a strong notion it's no use my trying to put sense into yo'?"  I were not i'
> th' best state, I'll own, for taking in what Hamper's friend had to say--I
> were so vexed at the way it were put to me;--but I thought, "Come, I'll see
> what these chaps has got to say, and try if it's them or me as is th' noodle."
> So I took th' book and tugged at it; but, Lord bless yo', it went on about
> capital and labour, and labour and capital, till it fair sent me off to sleep.
> I ne'er could rightly fix i' my mind which was which; and it spoke on 'em as
> if they was vartues or vices; and what I wanted for to know were the rights o'
> men, whether they were rich or poor--so be they only were men (229).

Higgins also explains eloquently the gap between truth in a book and truth in
a person's mind or beliefs.

> 'Well, sir,' said Higgins, rather doggedly; 'it might, or it might not.
> There's two opinions go to settling that point.  But suppose it was truth
> double strong, it were no truth to me if I couldna take it in.  I daresay
> there's truth in yon Latin book on your shelves; but it's gibberish and not
> truth to me, unless I know the meaning o' the words.  If yo', sir, or any
> other knowledgable, patient man come to me, and says he'll larn me what the
> words mean, and not blow me up if I'm a bit stupid, or forget how one thing
> hangs on another--why, in time I may get to see the truth of it; or I may not.
> I'll not be bound to say I shall end in thinking the same as any man.  And I'm
> not one who think truth can be shaped out in words, all neat and clean, as th'
> men at th' foundry cut out sheet-iron.  Same bones won't go down wi' every
> one.  It'll stick here i' this man's throat, and there i' t'other's.  Let
> alone that, when down, it may be too strong for this one, too weak for that.
> Folk who sets up to doctor th' world wi' their truth, mun suit different for
> different minds; and be a bit tender in th' way of giving it too, or th' poor
> sick fools may spit it out i' their faces.  Now Hamper first gi'es me a box on
> my ear, and then he throws his big bolus at me, and says he reckons it'll do
> me no good, I'm such a fool, but there it is' (230).
