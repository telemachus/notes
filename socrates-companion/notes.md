## Preface

The preface is tiny. The editors say that they are primarily focused on
Plato's Socrates, but that some essays look to other sources as well.
They instructed authors to present and evaluate contemporary views on their
topic, but also to present their own opinion. As such, different chapters
may differ and the editors do not necessarily support any particular
chapter as such.

## Chapter 1: The quest for the historical Socrates (Robin Waterfield)

Waterfield makes a compelling case that all contemporary attempts to
discover the *real* or *historical* Socrates are flawed. In fact, he
convinced me that no such investigation could possibly succeed given the
nature of our evidence. He surprised the hell out of me, however, by
offering his own *real* Socrates in the final part of the essay. Although
readers should judge for themselves, I find his reconstruction to be as
flawed and full of wish-fulfillment as the ones he criticizes earlier in
the essay.

## Chapter 2: Socratic Irony (Iakovos Vasiliou)

Vasiliou begins by observing that when we read Plato, we inevitably and
frequently ask questions like, "Is Socrates serious?" However, "the
possibility of wondering whether Aristotle or Kant is serious does not
arise; there is almost no space for that question to be intelligible."
Vlastos argues that this shows the manifest reality of some kind of play in
the case of Plato's Socrates. As he argues repeatedly, even if someone's
final interpretation is that Socrates *is* serious, this would need to be
*argued for* in the case of Socrates, and unlike (most) other philosophers.

Vasiliou then analyzes two main types of Socratic irony. Conditional irony,
which usually appears in Socrates' hyperbolic praise of his interlocutors,
involves a suppressed protasis: Socrates wants desperately to become Euthyphro's
student, *if Euthyphro knows what he claims to know about piety*. In these
cases, Socrates inevitably denies the implied antecedent, and by
implication, he denies the entire condition as well. (As Vasiliou points
out, this is formally a fallacy, but it is in line with normal
conversational implications: "I'll go to the movies with you, if I finish
studying for the test" is, in normal conversations, defeated by my not
finishing my studying, even if by logic this is a fallacy.) The other type
of irony is reverse irony, which usually appears when Socrates disavows
knowledge or asserts one of the Socratic paradoxes. In these cases,
Socrates provokes his interlocutors (and Plato's readers) by being
completely honest but saying something that listeners and readers are bound
to find impossible.

Vasiliou's analyses of these cases is very strong, but I have one quarrel
with his case. I'm not convinced that he has answered a problem raised by
Charles Griswold. Griswold notes that in many cases the audience for
Socratic irony must be Plato's readers and not any character internal to
the dialogues. If this is so, and Vasiliou seems to agree that it is---at
least in some cases---then the irony belongs to Plato rather than to
Socrates. It becomes part of Plato's communication with his readers rather
than anything Socrates communicates to anyone. Vasiliou seems to recognize
this partly, but he also wants to have it both ways. He argues that Plato
allows Socratic irony to have an audience that Socrates never finds in the
dialogues, an audience of us---Plato's readers. But that simply sounds to
me like a roundabout way of saying something that Vasiliou is at pains to
deny: much of the irony he covers is Platonic not Socratic.(ft. This issue
is complex. Vasiliou admits initially that in some sense *all* of the irony
is Platonic since he is the author of all of these words. However, he
insists that the irony he discusses throughout also belongs in an important
sense to Socrates the character. I don't think that he can make good on
that claim, ultimately.)

## Chapter 3: Socratic Philosophizing

Wolfsdorf considers a cluster of problems about Socratic method. Following
Vlastos, he begins with the Socratic elenchus, and he considers such
questions as these: Is the elenchus constructive or only destructive? Is
Socrates entitled to think that the elenchus can disprove specific theses
or can it only show inconsistency among a set of theses? Is the elenchus
Socrates' only method? Does Socrates investigate propositions or lives?
Does Socrates pursue truth via the elenchus (or any other method) or does
he only seek to display ignorance? Is the elenchus adversarial or
cooperative?

Unlike all the other contributions to the volume, Wolfsdorf arranges his
essay temporally. He examines 21 essays by various scholars in the order
they were published, and one by one he unpacks their views on his topic. He
does not present his own views or any summary views, and so the chapter is
impossible to further summarize. At the end of the essay, Wolfsdorf
recommends that future studies expand in two ways. First, they should move
beyond logic to "consider the psychological attitudes" of the speakers in
the dialogues, remaining open to the possibility that "Plato employs
Socrates and his interlocutors variously in different argumentative
contexts." Second, they should expand consideration of Socratic arguments
beyond the elenchus in order to consider the many other various ways in
which Socrates argues. Wolfsdorf grants that piecemeal work has been done
towards both goals, but he believes that far more work remains in order to
yield real results.

## Chapter 4: Socratic Metaphysics

Prior argues, against Dancy and Vlastos and with Allen and Fine, that the
character Socrates in the early dialogues *is* a metaphysician. He has an
ontology of forms that is in many essential ways similar to, and
a precursor for, the famous Platonic theory of forms that appears in the
middle dialogues.

Prior bases his argument on Socrates' use of the same language for Forms as
the middle period, Socratic arguments that objects like "justice" and
"piety" exist, are universals, explain the properties of actions, people
and so on, serve as standards for thought and action and are
self-predicating. In fact, the metaphysics of the early Socrates shares
everything with Plato except for separation of the Forms and Plato's
general other-worldliness, according to Prior. In this sense, the views we
find in the early dialogues clearly foreshadow and lead to the view of the
middle dialogues.

## Chapter 5: Socratic Ignorance and Types of Knowledge

McPartland discusses the tension between Socrates' frequent disavowals of
knowledge and his occasional knowledge claims. He points out immediately
that what Socrates disavows of claims to possess as 'knowledge' may differ
from what we understand by that word. Instead what Socrates disavows is an
extraordinarily strong and stable cognitive state, and what he possesses is
something very like justified true belief. On this account, the disavowals
and avowals that Socrates makes become far less shocking (and interesting)
than they appear at first glance. In addition, Socrates no longer
contradicts himself if the knowledge he disavows differs from the knowledge
he possesses. However, a different question emerges: Why does Socrates
insist that the superhuman cognitive state that he lacks (along with every
other person he has ever met and, as he sometimes implies, could ever meet)
is *essential* for happiness?

McPartland distinguishes three types of Socratic disavowals concerning
ethical knowledge:

+ Socrates denies that he has definitional knowledge of virtue (in general)
  as well as specific virtues.
+ Socrates denies that a person without definitional knowledge can know (1)
  what features a virtue possesses and (2) whether specific actions or
  sorts of actions belong are virtuous.
+ Socrates denies that he knows how to make people better. He cannot teach
  virtue.

## Chapter 6: The Priority of Definition

Socrates famously sought definitions for ethical terms, and Hugh Benson
considers his motivation for this pursuit. He admits that Socrates may have
had multiple motivations, but argues that a particularly important one was
Socrates' belief that definitions had "special epistemic status", namely
his belief that "knowledge of these answers is...epistemically prior to
other sorts of knowledge" (137).

The principle of the priority of definition:

> (PD) If A fails to know what F-ness is, then A fails to know anything
> about F-ness.

(PD) itself is a conjunction of two principles:

> (P) If A fails to know what F-ness is, then A fails to know, for any x,
> that x is F.

> (D) If A fails to know what F-ness is, then A fails to know, for any G,
> that F-ness is G.

Principle (P) is why, for example, Socrates worries in *Hippias Major* that
unless he can define the fine, he cannot say of any particular speech that
it is fine. Principle (D) is why, for example, Socrates says in *Republic
I* that he cannot say whether justice is beneficial for those who possess
it.

After a careful review of the textual evidence for and against Socratic
commitment to (PD) and the philosophical merits of the principle, Benson
asserts that (1) Socrates was committed to (PD) and that (2) (PD) itself is
more plausible than contemporary detractors have thought.

## Chapter 7: Socratic Eudaimonism (Naomi Reshotko)

Reshotko considers how Socrates understands *eudaimonia*, the "central
value and supreme goal of a human life" (156), and what he makes of the
relationship between *eudaimonia* and *aretē*, virtue or excellence.
According to Reshotko, Socrates pursues *eudaimonia* in a practical rather
than a theoretical manner. He does not seek a conceptual or logical
understanding of *eudaimonia*. Instead, Socrates wants to find real life
ways that are most likely to lead to *eudaimonia*. In addition, Reshotko
believes that it is anachronistic to use intentional contexts to explain
Socrates's radical views of human desire. Reshotko forcefully argues that
Socrates means it: People only desire what is truly good for them. She
does, however, admit that Socrates allows that things not actually for for
people might appear best to them as a result of ignorance or confusion. She
stresses the practicality and objectivity of Socrates's interest in
*eudaimonia*.

Reshotko argues that virtue is knowledge, but this definition can only
apply to people. Notice that in *Hippias Major* 295c8-e3, Socrates argues
for a definition of τὸ καλόν that cannot possibly be knowledge since it
must apply equally to people, animals, objects, boats and fields of study.
And Socrates explicitly says that the definition must apply to all things
"in the same manner" (295d6).

## Chapter 8: Socratic Moral Psychology

Their arguments about the power of appearance seem to proceed on *a priori*
grounds far more than by consideration of anything Socrates or any
interlocutor says. Their *a priori* opinions also don't strike me as
especially obvious.

A good contrast with Chapter 7. Reshotko tries to argue almost completely
from what Socrates (and other characters) say, while Brickhouse and Smith
care a great deal more about philosophical plausibility. They struggle to
make more room than Penner and Reshotko for non-rational persuasion. The
result will seem to many readers like a very weak or attenuated version of
motivational *intellectualism*.

## Chapter 9: Socrates on love (Suzanne Obdrzalek)

Obdrzalek reviews the Socratic theory of love, as found primarily in
Plato's *Lysis*. She begins with an objection by Vlastos that has been
central for later work: Vlastos objects that the Socratic theory is unduly
egoistic and that Socratic does not recognize truly other-regarding love.
Obdrzalek rejects arguments that escape this objection by finding
other-regarding love in the *Lysis*. Instead, she argues that theories of
other-regarding love are themselves problematic. Although I worry that this
amounts to burning down the village in order to save it, she makes serious
criticisms of two modern theories of other-regarding love.

## Errors

### Chapter 4

+ Complete inconsistency in how dialogue block quotes are introduced: bold,
  all-caps full names; abbreviated names, bold all caps; small-caps full
  names.
+ Citation of Nozick 1995 which does not appear in the bibliography.
  Reference is to 'Socratic Puzzles', Robert Nozick, Phronesis (40), 2,

### Chapter 8

+ Twice on page 194, they switch too rapidly from 'they' to 'we' when
