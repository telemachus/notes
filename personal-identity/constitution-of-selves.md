# *The Constitution of Selves* Marya Schechtman (Cornell, 1996)


## Introduction

According to Schechtman, contemporary philosophers misunderstand personal identity and, as a result, they fail to solve the problem they set themselves. Schechtman believes that there are several different problems about personal identity. She identifies two in particular: (i) the reidentification question: what makes someone now, the same person as an earlier or later person? and (ii) the characterization question: what psychological features make someone the person that they are? Philosophers make two mistakes. First, they focus exclusively on the reidentification question. Second, they drag elements from the characterization question into their work on the reidentification question. (Since they don't distinguish the two questions, they may be aware that they have introduced these elements, but they do not realize that they should not.)

If we focus on the characterization question, we have very practical considerations in mind. Personal identity provides the foundation for four basic aspects of life: (i) survival, (ii) moral responsibility, (iii) self-interested concern, and (iv) compensation. Schechtman calls these the "four features." Ordinary people care about the four features before they engage in any philosophical study of personal identity, and questions about the four features demand attention in everyday life.

Contemporary philosophers test their reidentification theories on the basis of the four features, but Schechtman argues that they should not. A characterization theory can account for the four features and their place in our lives. But even if we had a successful reidentification theory, Schechtman believes that it could not account for the four features. Philosophers who abuse a reidentification theory in order to account for the four features will misunderstand both reidentification and the four features themselves.

## Chapter 1: The Reidentification Question

When contemporary philosophers tackle the reidentification question, they address a specific instance of a more general metaphysical problem. The problem is this: what is the criterion of identity over time for objects. A criterion can be epistemological or metaphysical. It can concern how we know something or how something is what it is. In this case, we are concerned primarily with the metaphysical criterion. In order to specify such a criterion, philosophers attempt to give necessary and sufficient conditions.
