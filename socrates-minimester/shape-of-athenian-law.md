# *The Shape of Athenian Law*, S.C. Todd

## Method

### The Legacy of Athenian Law

The Greeks had a huge effect on subsequent societies, but not in the area of law. Their legal system had effectively no legacy. The ideas and words of subsequant legal systems come largely from Rome rather than Greece. A parallel case is religion where the Judeo-Christian tradition dominates the future.

Most modern and contemporary thinking about law derives from Roman ways of thinking about law. In the Roman system, (i) law is a normative discipline, (ii) the rules of law are independent of their social context, to one degree or another, and (iii) there should be a formal and systematic statement of the laws.

But none of these principles fits Athens well. Todd will argue that “law is never simply a normative discipline” (13). And in Athens there was no formal statements of their laws.

Because Athenian law is so different from what we are used to, Todd believes that existing scholarship has problems organizing the discussion of Athenian law. Since the Athenians themselves had no theory or overall structure for their laws or legal system, we can’t use that to organize our accounts. But if we use some other organization, e.g., the Roman one or English common-law, we risk misrepresenting the Athenian material. Many scholars have taken this route, and Todd doesn’t love the results. On the other hand, MacDowell avoids theory and methodology altogether, and that’s a problem too. Todd wants to minimize both problems, though he also thinks that in the end the problem is “probably insoluble” (16).

### Comparisons, Assumptions, and the Concept of ‘Shape’

Todd spends this chapter making a very modern point. He believes that he cannot completely avoid the perspective that he comes from, but he still wants to achieve some level of rationality in his approach. In order to do so, he will turn to legal anthropology and comparisons with American, British, and European systems. He hopes to avoid importing too much from Roman-based or contemporary systems, and that is why he turns to anthropology. In theory, anthropology will show how different things can be from what we know.

### Sources of Law: Sources of Information

Todd divides his investigation of sources into two chapters. In this first chapter, he considers how later historians and readers reconstruct Athenian law. In the next chapter, he considers how Athenians worked out what their own laws were. He says the first question is one for historians and the second question is one for lawyers.

Our main source for Athenian law is the speeches of the ten orators. Todd insists that we cannot trust these speeches. They are not case reports but lawyers’s speeches. A lawyer may lie about the facts and the law. In addition, we cannot be sure if the speeches were edited after delivery. If they were edited for publication, we cannot say where or how much.

### Sources of Law: Legal Sources

Todd begins by reviewing the sources of law in contemporary legal systems. Although he distinguishes carefully between the Continental tradition and the British/American system (the civil-law and the common-law systems), they both rely on three elements. Contemporary systems rely on statue law, customary law (precedents set by judges), and juristic writings (made by academic lawyers).

Athens has no jurists, and thus there is no professional group of people to give advice or guidance about the law. (This is not absolutely true. There are the “interpreters” that we hear about in *Euthyphro* and in a speech by Demosthenes. But we don’t have a very good understanding of what they did, and their role was limited, apparently to homicide. See Todd 31-32.) As such, Athenian law remained almost entirely a world of amateurs.

The Athenians did not organize or codify their law in a way that made it easy to use in trials. Individual laws went on *stêlai* that might be anywhere in the city. There was no process to ensure that different laws didn’t conflict, and there was no clear procedure to handle conflicts when they arose. Individual jurors decided for themselves, and then they voted. They never attempted to argue each other into consensus.

Todd goes even further than this. He argues as follows:

> It was not the task of the court to know or to discover what law or laws applied in particular circumstances; rather, it was the litigant’s right to bring forward any law(s) which he felt would support his case (Todd, 59).

Modern courts apply laws as rules that determine what outcomes to give for sets of facts. Athenian courts treat both facts and laws as evidence to present at a trial. Todd adds “Laws, like other forms of evidence, served to persuade rather than to bind an Athenian court” (60).

Athenian courts cannot rely heavily on precedent. Individual jurors never state their reasons. Thus, two jurors may vote the same way for completely different reasons. As such, a juror in a future trial must *guess* at what a previous decision meant. There is no report for future jurors to rely on.

In addition, laws in Athens tend not to define their terms. Therefore, each jury must interpret the law itself. Rivals in a courtroom often disagreed over statutes, and the jurors would all have to make their own decisions concerning all of this as they decided how to vote.

### The Shaping of Athenian Law

Todd uses this chapter to discuss briefly three main themes that will appear throughout the book. First, Todd considers Athenian law “primitive” in a specific sense. Namely, a legal system is primitive if it remains “exempt from the manipulative grasp of Roman (and especially post-classical Roman) law” (64). Second, Athenian law is deeply and essentially adversarial. Third, Athenian law relies “on assumptions substantially alien to those of modern jurisdictions” (68).

The second and third themes are quite clear, but the first is not. Todd explains better what he really means when he says that Athenian law, like other “primitive” systems, “begin with the procedural question” (65). In systems we are more familiar with, “the first thing to decide is what your rights are, beore considering whether and how to go to court to defend them” (65). But in ancient Athens, things go the other way around. The procedures available to you help you to figure out what rights you have. As Todd puts it, “rights in such a system can only exist when there is available a procedure to protect or indeed to create them” (65).

## Procedure

### The Personnel of Procedure

Athenian justice was largely an amateur affair. The *dikastai* were paid for their time, but they were not in any sense professional or expert in the law. There were *arkhai* who had roles in courts, but their roles were very limited. And they too were not legal experts; they were simply elected officials. Individual citizens initiated cases, and they plead cases themselves. There were *logographoi*, but you had to hide that fact.

There are some qualifications and exceptions. First, the Eleven are somewhat like a small court police. They ran jails and oversaw executions. In addition, they had great power in one extraordinary case: if someone was caught red-handed, the Eleven could execute that person without a trial. However, as Todd emphasizes, we aren’t sure what “red-handed” (*ep’ autophōrōi*) really meant, and they don’t seem to have done this very often.Second, several groups could levy various fine without a trial.

Who were the *dikastai*? The term itself can be translated either as *juror* or *judge*. A court would have a presiding magistrate, but he was a minor elected official, usually chosen by lot. In addition, the magistrate gave no legal advice or jury direction at all. In any given year, there were (supposedly?) 6000 citizens above 30 who swore the dikastic oath. Any of these people could serve in that year as a *dikastēs*. If you swear the oath, you don’t have to serve every day, and you don’t have a guaranteed job if you do show up. But juries are chosen from among the people out of that 6000 or so that show up every day. Public cases are generally 500; private cases were 200 or 400. Todd speculates that “the system tended to encourage farmers (including peasant farmers) to attend, rather than traders or artisans” (89), but he admits that this is a difficult question and a debatable opinion.

How did cases and verdicts work? There were two sides, and usually two litigants. The case was adversarial, and the *dikastai* had to vote for one or the other side. (In practice, they could apparently abstain from voting.) In some cases, after picking a side, the *dikastai* voted for one of two proposed penalties. There were no appeals from the verdicts in Athens. There was no rule of relevance, so speakers often ignored the details of the charges. There was nobody at the trial to tell them to do otherwise. Similarly, nobody told the *dikastai* how to decide a case the way that modern judges instruct jurors on the law and sometimes the facts.

### The Range of Procedures

How do *dikai* differ from *graphai*? *Dikai* must be started by the affected party. *Graphai* can be started by any citizen. Also, *graphai* seem to involve more significant and public issues; they carry greater penalties, but they also involve greater risk. If you fail to win 1/5 of the verdict vote, you will be fined—and maybe suffer other punishments. Finally, the word *dikē* can be used in a more general sense, in which case both (narrower) *dikai* and *graphai* are *dikai*.
