# The Skeptic’s Beliefs
(in *Essays in Ancient Philosophy*; University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis; 1987, pages 179-200)

## Introduction

> There are no views or beliefs that define Pyrrhonean Skepticism (179).

Frede begins from the claim above. He explains that sceptics don’t have “any specific doctrines or dogmas” that set them apart from any other school of philosophy. We shouldn’t even attribute the view that “nothing can be known” to these sceptics. After all, they claim that Academics are really (negative) dogmatists since they claim that nothing can be known. So, there is nothing a Pyrrhonian must admit simply insofar as they are a Pyrrhonian. In particular, they do not claim to have a deeper insight into things that allows them to refute the views of other schools. It is dogmatists who believe such things.

Frede contrasts this, however, with “a far more radical” interpretation of the sceptics (179). According to this “usual interpretation”, the sceptics disavow all knowledge (179), and they suspend judgment on all matters. They lack all knowledge and all belief.

Frede views this alternative view, however common, as “fundamentally mistaken” (179) and for at least two reasons. First, sceptics “cannot avoid knowing many things”. It would require “great effort, imagination, and cleverness” to make onself “know less and less”. Since we don’t have a reason to think the sceptics are trying to do any such thing, we can assume that they “simply cannot avoid knowing many things” and also that they will “often be aware of knowing, and not merely supposing, certain things” (179-180). And Frede doesn’t believe that this is incompatible with Sextus’s scepticism. Second, whatever we think about knowledge, Frede also thinks that (i) the sceptic has beliefs and (ii) these beliefs are compatible with Pyrrhonian scepticism. He will focus on belief in this essay, though I wish he had said more about knowledge.

## A problem for the standard interpretation

Frede concedes that a great deal suggests the standard view, but he raises what he takes to be a serious objection to the standard. There is a (pragmatic) inconsistency between having no beliefs whatsoever and doing anything at all. Frede refers in particular to Hume’s version of the objection that “if only he took his own views seriously”, the sceptic “would be completely helpless in ordinary life” (180). And Frede adds that ancient sceptics faced such an objection no later than Arcesilaus.

Frede argues on the basis of charity that we should take the sceptics more seriously in response to the *apraxia* argument. Since they faced various versions of the argument over hundreds of years, we should not lightly dismiss their counter-arguments. As he puts it “one violates the canons of interpretation if one does not take the skeptics’ constant protests—that this objection does not really tell against their position—at least as seriously as the fact taht they were constantly confronted by it” (180).

Frede imagines two different ways that the sceptics might argue in defense of their position. (i) They might argue that it is possible to avoid all beliefs and that doing so is compatible with action and (some form of) ordinary life. (ii) They might argue that although they suspend judgment on all matters in some sense, this suspension is compatible with having beliefs. And such beliefs make it possible for the sceptics to act and have a life. Frede believes that the sceptics took the second path. But before he gets into that, he considers three reasons to believe that they took the first path.

Here are those three reasons:

1. Sceptics often say that they suspend all beliefs.
1. Pyrrho may have attempted to live without belief, and he is generally thought of as a source of Pyrrhonian scepticism.
1. Sceptics often argue that action is possible without belief. This might look as though they are trying to fight off an objection to their own position.

Briefly, here are Frede’s responses to these arguments.

1. He passes over this except to note that “it will turn out that it is only true in a restricted sense...and that everything depends on how one construes this restriction” (181).
1. The evidence for Pyrrho’s life comes from Antigonus of Carystus, who was a near contemporary of Pyrrho’s. Frede doesn’t think that we can rule out that Antigonus meant this as serious biography, and not as a “critical caricature” (181). (If it were merely a caricature, then it would not be evidence for anything but the view that scepticism makes ordinary life impossible. It could not then itself be evidence for the appropriateness of this attack without begging the question.) However, Frede doesn’t think that we need to worry very much about what Pyrrho did since (i) all other sceptics seem to have led very ordinary lives and (ii) “Pyrrho’s influence on Pyrrhonean skepticism is far less than generally assumed” (182).
1. If we interpret sceptical arguments as their own solution to the challenge of *apraxia*—a solution that they accept, even if we don’t—then the sceptic “would be trying to deny what quite obviously is the case, viz., that actions presuppose beliefs, by relying on a theoretical dogmatic argument which purports to show that action is possible even without assent to appearances” (184). But this is precisely what a sceptic “usually criticizes the dogmatist for doing”. Thus Frede prefers to see the arguments that sceptics offer against dogmatic *apraxia* arguments as cases of the sceptic “simply following their usual strategy of providing equipollent arguments on both sides of every issue”. In addition, Frede argues that it is “scarcely plausible” to imagine a sceptic actually arguing for a more or less normal human life without any beliefs. In addition to the theoretical problem, which the arguments for action without belief might address, there is a practical problem. In the normal course of life, people acquire beliefs. A sceptic would need to show us (i) how to rid ourselves of all previous beliefs, (ii) how to prevent forming new ones, and (iii) how (i) and (ii) can be done in such a way that what is left is still recognizable as a human life at all. The problem is that even if we can imagine ways to accomplish (i)-(iii), “what, besides sheer dogmatism, would lead someone to make use of this possibility” (184). (Note: I think that critics of Frede’s position have not adequately answered this two-part argument: the practical problem and the dogmatism it suggests.)

Frede then considers a possible objection that it is not dogmatism but the experience of tranquillity that leads the sceptic “to resist the ordinary way of thinking about things” (185). Frede offers two responses. The first response relies on his larger interpretation of the sceptic’s ἐποχή, so I will pass over that for now. Frede also responds that the objection doesn’t answer the practical problem: “For while this objection could perhaps explain why the skeptic leads a life without beliefs, once he has discovered that a life without beliefs is a tranquil one, our problem was seeing what would lead the skeptic to discover this in the first place. For the skeptic to make this discovery, however, he must either bring it about that he is in a state in which he has no beliefs or somehow be put into such a state. What, though, could bring him into such a state, on what grounds coul he bring himself into such a state; they could only be dogmatic ones” (185).

Perhaps we can blunt the force of Frede’s argument here. He seems to believe that the sceptic’s discovery of tranquillity is all or nothing. That is, the sceptic only comes to ἀταραξία after she loses *all* of her beliefs. At first, we might think that we can interpret *PH* I 12 in another way. Perhaps Sextus says there only that we discover tranquillity piecemeal; for each belief we give up, we gain *some* peace of mind. However, if we turn to the text, this isn’t the case. Instead, Sextus says very clearly συστάσεως δὲ τῆς σκεπτικῆς ἐστὶν ἀρχὴ μάλιστα τὸ *παντὶ λόγῷ* λόγον ἴσον ἀντικεῖσθαι· ἀπὸ γὰρ τούτου καταλήγειν δοκοῦμεν εἰς τὸ μὴ δογματίζειν (I 12, emphasis mine). And it is immediately after this that Sextus explains in what sense a sceptic does or does not δογματίζειν.

## Frede on *PH* I 13

Frede believes that this puzzle over interpretation is “solved for us by Sextus Empiricus’ own words” (186). In *PH* I 13 Sextus explains in what sense a sceptic does not δογματίζειν. In particular, Sextus distinguishes between a wider and a narrower sense of δόγμα, and he asserts that sceptics only disavow the narrower sense of dogma, according to which δόγμα εἶναί φασί τινες τήν τινι πράγματι τῶν κατὰ τὰς ἐπιστήμας ζητουμένων ἀδήλων σθγκατάθεσιν· ούδενὶ γὰρ τῶν ἀδήλων συγκατατίθεται ὁ Πυρρώνειος (I 13). Just after this, Sextus adds that all of a sceptics utterances need to be taken in this special way. When a dogmatist asserts something, they do so ὡς ὑπάρχον, but the sceptic uses their utterances (φωνάς) οὐχ ὡς πάντως ὑπαρχούσας.[^1]

Frede says that we need to answer two questions about I 13. First, what sorts of beliefs do sceptics have. Second, how is it compatible for the sceptic to hold these beliefs but also suspend judgment about everything. Before doing this, however, he raises an interpretation of sceptical beliefs that he wishes to reject.

## Do sceptics have beliefs only about how things appear?

Frede considers the view of “[t]hose who incline toward an interpretation according to which the skeptic has no beliefs even in everyday life” (186). Such readers argue that we must “distinguish between how things are and how they appear” (186). The sceptic will have no beliefs about how things are, and thus no *real* beliefs at all. However, a sceptic can have beliefs about how things appear. Furthermore, Frede grants that there are passages in Sextus that suggest this view. He cites *PH* I 22 in particular: “no one, presumably, disputes that the underlying thing appears to be such or such; what is in question is whether the thing is as it appears to be.”

Frede counters that “although there is a sense in which the skeptic has no beliefs about how things are—namely, he has no beliefs about how things *really* are—there is a perfectly good sense in which he does have beliefs about how things are—namely, to the extent that it seems to be the case that things are so and so” (186). The distinction between “how things are” and “how things *really* are” may not be obvious, but Frede offers two kinds of evidence for such a distinction in Sextus. (i) Sextus often uses phrases with φύσις to mark reality (he cites *PH* I 27, 78, 140). (ii) Frede mentions the use of ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ at I 20.[^2] (He will discuss this phrase more later.)

Frede explains this distinction by describing a general program among dogmatists. Greek philosophers believed “it is possible to go behind the surface phenomena to the essence of things, to the nature of things, to true reality” (187). They further believe that “it is reason...that can lead us beyond the world of appearances to the world of real being” (187). As an example, Frede refers to everyday views about color versus a modern scientific view of color as only objects reflecting light of specific wave-lengths. (I think it’s no accident that Frede uses a modern example here rather than an ancient one. But he doesn’t draw this point out.) Insofar as reason and theory are concerned, a sceptic can reach no answer about how things are. But that doesn’t mean that a sceptic has no views about how things are. And so Frede argues that the sceptic suspends judgment only about how things *really* are in this sense, and not about how things are in an everyday sense.

## Do sceptics use language of appearance only in a non-doxastic sense?

Frede raises an even more serious objection: perhaps when sceptics say that something appears or seems such-and-such to them, they are using “appear” or “seem” in a non-doxastic[^3] sense.

[^1]: These passages might give more point to Frede’s distinction between “beliefs about how things are” and “beliefs about how things *really* are” (186). See also Benjamin Morison “Sextus Empiricus” in SEP.

[^2]: Readers disagree enormously over the meaning and importance of this phrase. See, for example, Perrin in *The Cambridge Companion*, Fine in “Sceptical dogmata”, and Brunschwig’s article on the phrase.

[^3]: Fine (in “Sceptical dogmata”, 83, note 11) prefers “non-doxastic” since it is a question of belief (δόξα) and not knowledge (ἐπιστήμη). On the one hand, this makes sense. On the other hand, “epistemic” is already quite common in this use. And the use makes sense since a “nonepistemic” appearance is one that has no tendency to get us closer to knowledge.
