# I General Doubt

W[ilson] makes many interesting points in her discussion of the first meditation, but I want to pick out three. First, she argues forcefully that the dreaming argument does not suggest that we cannot tell if we are awake or not. Second, she has a very productive way of viewing the doubts in the first meditation generally. Third, she raises troubling but useful questions concerning the connection between doubt and action.


## How does the dreaming argument work?

W argues that a very common reconstruction of the dreaming argument, according to which the argument suggests that we can never be certain we are awake, is mistaken. W’s argument, briefly, is that the common view doesn’t reach the conclusion that Descartes wants. According to W Descartes hopes to conclude that we cannot “know with certainty that the senses ever afford us truth at all (apart from the reality of simples)” (18). An argument that we cannot ever be certain whether we are awake or asleep will not yield this conclusion, or at least W argues that it will not. Therefore, W offers an alternative.

On W’s view Descartes argues that dreaming shows us that ordinary perception may be “thoroughly delusory” because dreaming is relevantly like ordinary perception. Her reconstruction runs as follows (22):

1. I believe I have in the past dreamed that, for example, I was sitting in a chair (with no feeling of sensory limitation, etc.), when it was false that I was sitting in a chair.
1. If I see no certain marks to distinguish the present occasion from past occasions when I believe I was deceived, I have reason to believe I may be on the present occasion deceived.
1. I see no certain marks to distinguish the present occassion from such past occasions.
1. I have reason to suppose I may be deceived in my present belief that I am sitting in a chair.

This argument can be generalized in order to “reach the final conclusion Descartes wants” (22-23).

1. I believe in the past I have dreamed that I was perceiving various physical objects at close range when it was false that I was really perceiving any such objeccts (when my experience was thoroughly delusory).
1. If I see no certain marks to distinguish waking experience of physical objects from dream experience when, I believe, I was deceived, I have reason to believe my waking experience too may be deceptive.
1. I see no such certain marks to distinguish waking experience from dreams.
1. Therefore, I have reason to suppose that waking experience too may be deceptive (thoroughly delusory).
1. But if I have reason to suppose my waking experience may be deceptive (thoroughly delusory), I have reason to doubt the existence of physical objects (for at present we are supposing this experience to be the best foundation for our belief in physical objects).

W summarizes thus:

> Here the source of doubt is not located in the problem of knowing one is awake; it is rather expressed in the claim that I cannot say *why I should unquestioningly regard waking experience of physical objects as real or veridical, when there are no marks to distinguish it from the ‘illusions of dreams’* (23).

At the same time, W admits that her reading of the evidence does not fit *all* of what Descartes says about dreams. However, she points out that the common reconstruction has the same problem: it fits some but not all the evidence. Nevertheless, she feels that her alternative is the better option, primarily because it reaches the right conclusion.
