## Pliny (5.5.4)

> Those who live from day to day immersed in pleasures see their reasons for
> living completed every day whereas those who think of posterity and prolong
> the period for which they will be remembered through their work, for them
> death is always sudden since it interrupts something before itâ€™s finished.
