# Apparent Conflict

(Stephen Everson, *Phronesis*, volume 30, Number 3 (1985), 305-313)

**NB**: This is a review article of *The Modes of Scepticism* by Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes.

## Introduction

Everson begins by dismissing the importance of conflicting appearances. He rattles off a handful of simple examples (some coffee seems bitter to me but not to you, the tower looks large and square from nearby but small and round from far off, etc.), but he then asks: “So what? So—very little in fact” (305). Although conflicting appearances are a standard sceptical weapon, Everson argues that their power is “undeserved” (305). In Everson’s view, “a causal account of perception” means that “these sorts of differences are just what we should expect” (305). After all “Variations in the causal conditions should produce variations in the appearance of an object” (305). Conflicting appearances would only be a problem for us, argues Everson, if “there are no causal regularities holding between objects, conditions and perceptions or...we could not discover such regularities. Fortunately, neither is the case” (305). Everson also points out that it would “be more disconcerting if the appearances never conflicted whatever the circumstances” (305).

Everson makes some general comments about the book and the history of philosophical interpretation of the modes and Pyrrhonism more generally. In particular, he briefly explains that ancient scepticism attacks belief, not merely knowledge, and he reminds us that the extremity of such scepticism was lost over time. In fact, Everson cites an example of a contemporary philosopher (Peter Unger) who believes that he is being novel when he attacks belief (307). Everson also explains that Annas and Barnes (hereafter AB) hold that Sextus was a radical sceptic in the following ways:

1. Sextus did not insulate his scepticism. He didn’t attack only philosophical theories.
1. Sextus disavowed *all* beliefs not merely some of them.
1. Sextus was aware of the *apraxia* argument, and he had a cogent reply.

Unfortunately, according to Everson, AB “whet[] our appetite...however, they do not reveal what this reply actually was” (308), though Everson notes that they give some hints in their comments on the tenth mode. Everson also regrets that AB do not consider how the modes themselves should affect our view of the debate over global versus mitigated scepticism. (In particular, he wonders whether they are “consistent with a restricted scepticism—and, if not, how do they stand against Sextus’ own claims that the Pyrrhonist does not attack ordinary life (cf. *PH* II 246)?” (308).

Everson also notes that the modes “raise particular questions” in the debate about the scope of scepticism (308). Some readers see an unrestricted scepticism in Sextus, a scepticism that attacks everyday beliefs as well as philosophical theories; other readers argue that Sextus does various things to limit or insulate his sceptical attacks. So we may wonder whether the ten modes attack advanced theories or ordinary life as well; we may also wonder if the modes are “consistent with a restricted scepticism” (308). AB argue that Sextus is an unrestricted sceptic who attacks ordinary belief as well as philosophical theories.
