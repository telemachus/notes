# L’épicurisme: école et tradition, Diskin Clay

(in *Lire Épicure et les épicuriens*, edd. Alain Gigandet and Pierre-Marie Morel)

## Les débuts

The name ‘Epicurus’ is relatively rare in Greek, though several disciples of Epicurus name their children after the Master. Clay reminds us that the ἐκίκουροι in Plato’s *Republic* are subordinates who help the Guardians of the ideal city. Socrates mentions these allies near the myth of the division of citizens into metals, gold, silver, and bronze (415 A). Clay notes that for many historians of philosophy, ancient and modern, Epicurus himself has belonged to the race of silver (at best?), while Plato is the race of gold. However, the disciples of Epicurus viewed their master as a universal herald and savior (5).

Epicurus was an Athenian, but he was not born in Athens. In this way, Epicurus was unlike Plato but similar to Aristotle (from Macedonia) and Zeno (from Citium) (6). Epicurus was born in 341 on Samos to parents who emigrated from Athens. He died in Athens in 270 (6). Epicurus arrived in Athens around 307 or 306, during the archonship of Anaxicrates. Among several ancient lives or biographical sketches of Epicurus, the most important is that of Diogenes Laertius. (His work inspired many of the others that we have.) In addition, Diogenes of Oeneanda provides us with two letters of Epicurus which teach us about the early years of his life (6).

## La première génération de l’École épicurienne d’Athènes

We don’t know a great deal about the details of his doctrines or manner of life in Athens, but we do know that he attracted several disciples and students in his lifetime. In particular, he was close with people from Lesbos and Lampsacus, and he remained close with them throughout his life. Clay mentions several voyages to Lampsacus that show up in Epicurus’s letters and that one of his final letters, on his deathbed, was written to Idomeneus of Lampsacus (6-7).

Clay attributes some of the attraction of Epicureanism to the sense of φιλία, which was closer to a family than friendship, in the Garden. He also connects the frequent use of personal letters (with a more public and official message) to this sense of family among the members. He notes in passing that we have letters as far back as 300/299 and as late as 271/270 (8-9).

Epicurus asked his successors and students to memorize his works, but Clay notes that he cannot have meant all of them. Clay insists, reasonably enough, that Epicurus’s *DRN* is impossible to memorize (even *à Épicure lui-même* 10). However, according to Clay, several works from later in Epicurus’s career can be memorized and serve Epicurus’s purpose admirably. Epicurus wanted to ensure the survival of his system, and so he wrote several short letters and his Kuriae Doxae. These do exactly what Epicurus intended: they give followers the basics in an easy-to-memorize manner (10-11). (They also provided Lucretius with the stucture of his *DRN*, according to Clay (11).)

Epicurus also created hero cults in order to help preserve his school and views. Clay objects that these cults are ‘in flagrant contradiction’ to two of Epicurus’s fundamental doctrines: (1) live hidden and (2) death is nothing to us (11). However, there’s no logical contradiction here, and I’m not even convinced that there must be a practical contradiction. Individuals can live their life without concern for death and hidden from the larger political and social community, while still observing community-bonding rituals in festivals for early creators of the school. And the early creators themselves had no idea that these hero cults would be created, so nothing about the cults deformed their motivations or behavior.

Epicurus was smart in his use of religious machinery, whether or not it fit in with his other philosophical beliefs. VS 32 says ‘The person who feels veneration towards the sage enjoys a great benefit’. In Clay’s view, Epicurus made good on this maxim by his use of heroic cult to bind together his Garden, both during his lifetime and after his death (12).

## Les Successeurs

Clay draws attention to a crucial shift in the organization and tone of the Garden between its early days and later phases. Initially, the students were φίλοι and συμφιλοσοφοῦντες. There was no divide in authority or subordination. Philodemus’s *On frankness of speech*, however, shows that individual initiates were assigned to proficients and that the school as a whole was devoted to the ideas of the leaders of earlier days (14). It certainly seems that by the time it was an established school, the Garden and similar Epicurean outposts were run in a highly top-down manner, with all authority ultimately flowing back to the words of *ipse* Epicurus (15). (On that note, Clay says that we can call Epicurus, Metrodorus, Hermarchus, and Polyaenus a ‘four-horse team’ if we like, but ‘Epicurus was indeed their driving force’ (15).

## L’expansion vers l’Ouest

Clay first outlines the furthest reaches of Epicurean philosophy in all directions. The center remained in Athens. Within continental Greece, there were Epicureans as far north as Chalchis and Thebes in Boeotia. To the west, there were Epicureans in Italy at Rome, as well as south in Naples, Herculaneum and Sorrento. To the east, Epicureans were in Pergamum, Cos, Rhodes, and Oenoanda, as well as further north all the way to Amastris on the south shore of the Black Sea. Further south, Epicureans reached all the way to Egypt (16).

Philodemus of Gadara (circa 110-40 BCE) is a central figure in Italian Epicureanism (16). In the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, we find an amazing library. The villa itself probably belonged to L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (against whom Cicero wrote his *Contra Pisonem*). Philodemus dedicated some of his philosophy to Piso and also wrote an epigram to him, inviting Piso to an Epicurean celebration. All of the Greek books in the library are philosophical: mostly works of Philodemus himself, but also works by Epicurus, Metrodorus, Colotes, Chryippus, and several others. Unlike the the Epicurean library in Athens, the villa also contains works in Latin: a hexameter poem on Actium, fragments of Caecilius and Ennius. (Clay guesses that there must have been Lucretius there as well (17).)

According to Clay, the generation of Philodemus had a much broader range of interests than early Epicurean. And in two senses: first, they read non-Epicureans; second, they considered a wider range of philosophical questions than the early Epicureans. He cites writings on mathematics, rhetoric, poetry, and broad questions in theology. For theology in particular, Clay argues that ‘othodoxy is only possible when the doctrine is clear and intelligible—and as a result defensible’ (18). The difficulties of Epicurean theology thus drove later Epicureans to break with orthodoxy, according to Clay.

What does it mean that Philodemus ignores the contemporary Epicurean communities around Naples? For Clay, the larger point is that Philodemus strives to return to the practice of Epicurus. Philodemus follows Demetrius Lacon in his attempts to reconstruct (edit?) the text of Epicurus. In addition to work on the text, Philodemus also fought against contemporary Epicureans who suggested ‘deviant’ interpretations of the Master. At the same time, Philodemus also enters into arguments against contemporary Stoics (18). The only time that Philodemus mentions an Epicurean gathering in his own time, however, is when he invites Piso to an anniversary gathering in honor of Epicurus (18).

Unlike Philodemus, Lucretius acknowledges no other Epicureans and no contemporary philosophical scene. Clay borrows Otto Regenbogen’s description of Lucretius as a ‘lone wolf’ (18). This is all the more striking, since the Epicureans were all over Italy at this time, accordning to Cicero (18, Clay refers to *TD* IV 6-7 and *de Fin* II 14). Clay points out, very helpfully, that Lucretius often uses important Latin terms (e.g., *amicitia*) in an Epicurean rather than Roman sense. At the same time, Lucretius employs the first person (singular and plural) in two very different ways. On the one hand, he uses ‘our’ to indicate that he is a Roman, like his intended audience. On the other hand, he uses ‘our’ to signify his connection to fellow Epicureans. In the first sense, he will say ‘noster Ennius’; but in the second sense, he will say ‘we, Epicureans’.

## L’expansion vers la Lycie et le littoral méridional du Pont-Euxin

In 1888 Georges Cousin discovered a limestone bloc with a portion of a name, ‘DIOGENO’. What he found is the genitive (‘DIOGENOUS’) of the author of a large inscription on a portico near the mountain Oenoanda. This large inscription is the final major Epicurean primary source from antiquity. Clay believes that the inscription dates from the time of Marcus Aurelius (161-180) and that Diogenes was therefore a contemporary of Lucien and Galen (21).

Clay offers several reasons why the Diogenes inscription is important (22).

+ Diogenes preserves four letters of Epicurus (in part?) that we would not otherwise know about (to his mother, to Hermarchus, to Dositheus, and to his friends in Lampsacus).
+ The inscription preserves several important ethical maxims of Epicurus.
+ We learn about a network of Epicurean communities in the Antonine age from the inscription.
+ We see the continuation of the use of personal letters as encyclicals. Diogenes himself wrote letters to one person but with a broader audience in mind.

We have subsidiary evidence of Epicurean activity in this time from Galen, Lucian, and Philostrates. We also get a glimpse of the Garden in Heliorodus’s *Ethiopians*. Clay argues taht in the 4th century—and even after the Goth’s invasion of Athens in 267—there were no more Epicureans in Athens to live in the Garden (23).

## Adhésion et orthodoxie

Clay begins by citing the famous remark of Numenius that other schools—Platonists and Stoics in particular—have civil wars but the Epicureans have a peaceful succession without dissent. But Clay immediately qualifies this by pointing out that even if this is true in Athens, we certainly know about some controversy. His first proof is the debate over the status of rhetoric that we learn of from Philodemus. He also cites several figures by name who were heretics in one way or another—he doesn’t specify how, though he refers to Erler who does apparently. Finally, Clay refers to the use of poetry by Philodemus and Lucretius, which violates a famous saying of Epicurus 23-24).

However, for Clay, the greatest controversy for all Epicureans was to understand and then defent Epicurean theology (24). In Clay’s view, (i) Epicurus did not explain his theology clearly and (ii) insofar as Epicurus did explain his theology, it conflicts with his physics. Thus, it was inevitable that different successors would disagree with each other over how best to explain and justify Epicurean theology. However, Clay stresses that all of the successors were pursuing the same goal: to loyally explain and defend their Master.
