# Notes on *Intention*, G.E.M. Anscombe

## "The subject introduced under three heads"

As soon as we start the book, we get a lesson in how important the table of
contents will be. Although the text itself does not make this entirely
explicit, Anscombe organizes the book under three ways of looking at
intention: "expression of intention for the future, intentional action, and
intention in acting" (iii).

Anscombe makes another important point in the first section itself: "if we set
out to describe this concept [namely, intention], and took only one of these
three kinds of statement as containing our whole topic, we might very likely
say things about what 'intention' means which it would be false to say in one
of the other cases" (1).  Anscombe explicitly says that 'intention' has
different senses, but nevertheless she denies that "the word is equivocal as
it occurs in these different cases" (1).

Anscombe observes further "Where we are tempted to speak of 'different senses
of a word which is clearly not equivocal, we may infer that we are in fact
pretty much in the dark about the character of the concept which it
represents" (1).  She proposes (therefore?) to handle the subject "piecemeal,"
and she begins with expressions of intention (1).

## Wiseman on three voices in *Intention*

Rachael Wiseman argues that there are three distinct types of statement in
*Intention*.  In addition, she claims that we will likely misunderstand the
meaning of the book unless we distinguish these three types of statement.
After I lay out the three voices, I'll say a bit more about each one.

1. First, there are statements that express "a contstraint on an account of
   intention" (69).  Wiseman calls this the descriptive voice.
2. Second, there are statements "in which [Anscombe] develops an account"
   (69).  Wiseman calls this the philosophical voice.
3. Third, there are statements which express "an intuitive or
   plausible-sounding picture which Anscombe means to reject.  Wiseman calls
   this the intuitive voice.

As Wiseman explains, Anscombe uses the descriptive voice when she shares
statements that she feels do not require a theory or justification.  Instead,
any theory of the subject in question must confirm or explain statements made
in the descriptive voice.  In a later article, Anscombe calls a descriptive
statement "something that isn't a philosophical thesis at all, and which no
one denies" (Anscombe 1979, 211).  As an example, Wiseman discusses Anscombe's
statement that "a [person] may know that [they are] doing a thing under one
description, and not under another" (*Intention*, 11).  Many readers thought
that Anscombe was making a philosophical thesis here, something that relied on
a theory of the identify of events and that Anscombe would and could defend by
argument.  But Anscombe had no such theory or defense.  In a later article,
she wrote, "I thought of [the phrase 'under a description'] as a tool in the
philosophy of action, I thought of it as something that couldn't be called in
question or misunderstood" (Anscombe 1979, 208).

How does Anscombe explain the relationship of theories and what Wiseman calls
statements in the descriptive voice?  Anscombe writes "A theory, I suppose, will
at least (a) determine answers in obscure or borderline cases; (b) give an
interpretation of known facts. It may sometimes also correct generally received
statements in the light of new knowledge of a general scientific nature" (210).
However, she argues that only (b) would apply to the kind of statements she
makes in what Wiseman calls the descriptive voice.  That is, Anscombe denies
that a theory could show such statements to be wrong.  In fact, it only works
the other way around.  If a theory of a given domain denies a descriptive
statement from the same domain, then such a theory is "a non-starter" (210).

How would Anscombe defend her view that descriptive statements can rule out
theories?  I suspect she would argue on Wittgensteinian grounds that anyone
who denies a descriptive statement makes themselves unintelligible to us. They
demonstrate that they don't participate in our form of life if they deny such
a basic claim as that "a [person] may know that [they are] doing a thing under
one description, and not under another."

Do I find this persuasive?  Somewhat, yes.  However, I also worry.  It seems
obvious enough that one person's descriptive statement will be another
person's wild impossibility.  By itself, such disagreements do not show that
Anscombe and Wittgenstein are wrong, but I wonder whether we should sometimes
interpret the disagreements in ways other than they do.
