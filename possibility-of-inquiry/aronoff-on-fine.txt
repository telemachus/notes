Gail Fine published 'Inquiry in the <i>Meno</i>' in 1992[[1]], and after twenty-plus years of related work, her <i>Possibility of Inquiry</i> offers a detailed investigation into ancient philosophers on inquiry. In addition to Plato, <i>The Possibility of Inquiry</i> considers Aristotle, Epicureans, Stoics, Skeptics and Plutarch. This book is challenging and thought-provoking; it requires and repays patient study. Fine cares deeply about Meno's paradox itself, but she also uses it to illuminate ancient epistemology more broadly Thus this book should find a wide audience among scholars of ancient philosophy. (Although the writing is clear and jargon-free and no knowledge of Greek is required, the work places heavy demands on its readers. Advanced undergraduates might be able to read it, but they are not the target audience.)

Roughly half of the book is about the <i>Meno</i>, and Fine's discussion of Plato is the heart of the volume. Plato is primary for Fine since "he devotes more attention to our main concerns" than the other philosophers she examines (3). By "our main concerns" I take it that Fine means "concerns that should interest contemporary philosophical readers". Plato was not the first or the only ancient philosopher to investigate the paradox of inquiry, but his investigation is the most fruitful, in Fine's eyes. In addition, Fine can be briefer in the second half of the book because she has clarified so many details while discussing Plato (3). I will follow Fine and focus on Plato.

Here, briefly, are the key points of Fine's interpretation of Meno's paradox in Plato:[[2]]

<q>
1. When Socrates disavows knowledge, he means that he lacks P-knowledge.[[3]] Socrates' disavowal is consistent with his having true beliefs and strong convictions about the same things he disavows knowledge of.

2. Meno, however, misinterprets his and Socrates' lack of knowledge. Meno thinks that he and Socrates are "in a cognitive blank" about what they do not know (82; see also the General Index <i>sv</i> 'cognitive blank'). To put this in other terms, Meno thinks that he and Socrates have literally no idea about ἀρετή.

3. As a result of his confusion, Meno poses the paradox of inquiry: how can you even inquire about something, if you are in a cognitive blank about that matter (80d5-8)? Socrates accepts this challenge as important and restates it more formally as a dilemma (80e1-5).

4. Socrates answers the dilemma via a distinction between true belief and knowledge. Meno is correct that it is impossible to inquire into something, if you are in a cognitive blank about it. But Socrates is not in a cognitive blank about virtue; he has true beliefs about it, even if he lacks P-knowledge. The discussion about geometry between Socrates and a slave (82b-85c) is proof by example. The slave does not know the answer to Socrates' initial question, but he has many true beliefs about geometry, and he can gain new true beliefs, and eventually even knowledge, by inquiring.

5. The distinction between true belief and knowledge proves that inquiry is possible. Thus, this distinction answers Meno's paradox: even in the absence of knowledge, inquiry is possible if one relies on true belief. The theory of recollection, on the other hand, makes a related but distinct point. Its aim is to show how inquiry can be successful. Unfortunately Plato remains vague about recollection. He doesn't reveal how recollection explains successful inquiry (165).

6. Plato does not argue for nor rely on innate knowledge in the <i>Meno</i>. Instead, Plato only relies on prenatal knowledge: before birth a person's incorporeal soul possesses knowledge, but that knowledge is lost upon birth when a soul enters a body.
</q>

Fine's analysis is patient, detailed, insightful, and philosophically rich. Although I will focus on two disagreements below, I want to stress that anyone who reads Plato's <i>Meno</i> will profit from considering Fine's careful interpretation.

We should be very surprised by the claim that Meno takes himself and Socrates to be in a cognitive blank concerning virtue. When Meno challenges Socrates with the paradox of inquiry, he and Socrates have been engaged in a discussion of virtue for ten Stephanus pages. They have each asked questions about and stated opinions about virtue. It seems highly uncharitable to claim that Meno has forgotten this and now believes that he and Socrates are completely without cognitive content about virtue. (Fine doesn't discuss this problem, so I'm unsure how she would reply to it.[[4]])

When Fine uses the phrase 'in a cognitive blank', she cannot mean 'very confused about'. It would be easy enough to show that by 80d5 Meno has become very confused about virtue. He admits as much himself in the famous analogy where he compares Socrates to a torpedo fish (80b). But being very confused and being in a cognitive blank about something are not the same. And Fine makes it very clear (e.g., 70-71) that she means the stronger claim. According to Fine, Meno treats the following as exclusive options, subject to the Law of the Excluded Middle:

<q>
1. Meno has knowledge about virtue.
2. Meno is in a cognitive blank about virtue.
</q>

As I've argued above, this doesn't suit the context of Meno's paradox, but in addition it is inherently implausible—what would motivate anyone to believe this? When Socrates disavows <i>knowledge</i> of virtue, his audience is always shocked. How could a contemporary Greek believe that they have no cognitive content about virtue whatsoever? Fine raises the general difficulty, but her discussion is atypically curt and indecisive. She wonders "[w]hy might Meno have misunderstood Socrates" (82) as saying that not knowing is tantamount to being in a cognitive blank, but she offers only vague suggestions in reply. Given how extreme and odd a position Fine attributes to Meno, more is required.

A related worry is that Fine does not sufficiently spell out what she means by 'in a cognitive blank'. She writes that Meno "no longer has any views about virtue: he takes himself to be in a cognitive blank about virtue" (70). If we take this literally, then Meno has no beliefs, no knowledge, no ideas, no suppositions, etc. about virtue. In a footnote to this same passage, Fine says Meno "thinks no mental contents are available to him that would allow him to inquire, or even to say anything, about virtue". Taken literally, this is certainly strong enough to fit Fine's reading of Meno's paradox. However, Meno can't mean quite this. He is clearly aware, for example, <i>that he and Socrates are talking about virtue</i>. This may seem like a trivial or nitpicky objection. But the problem remains that Fine needs an interpretation of 'in a cognitive blank' weak enough to rule out such trivial objections but strong enough to support her interpretation. The meaning of 'in a cognitive blank' would need to fit Plato's text and the context of Meno's paradox and also suit Fine's argument. I'm unsure if there is any such interpretation of this phrase available to Fine.

My second concern is that Fine minimizes the theory of recollection. Fine argues that Socrates replies to Meno in three stages: (1) initial mention of the theory of recollection, (2) an interlude where Socrates cross-examines one of Meno's slaves about geometry, and (3) a second discussion of recollection. It is unobjectionable to claim that there are three stages here. However, Fine tends to describe stage two as if it were something distinct from the theory of recollection. On her interpretation, recollection appears in sections (1) and (3), but the cross-examination of the slave demonstrates the distinction between true belief and knowledge.

I have trouble accepting that the three stages are distinct in this way. To see why, consider the overall run of the conversation at this point in the dialogue. After Meno presents his paradox, he asks Socrates what he thinks of the problem (81a1-2). Socrates confidently answers that it does not seem like a good argument to him because of an account he has heard from priests and poets. This account reveals that the soul is immortal and what we call learning is actually recollection of things the soul knew before this life (81a3-e2). Socrates appears here to suggest <i>that</i> inquiry is possible because of recollection. (Thus Fine may misjudge what recollection attempts to show.) Meno does not quite follow, and he asks Socrates to explain (81e3-82a6). Socrates agrees and begins his cross-examination of the slave (82a7 ff.) The cross-examination of the slave, as this shows, doesn't break away from recollection, as Fine would have it. Socrates' introduction of recollection, in what Fine calls the first stage, was allusive and brief. The cross-examination of the slave makes recollection clearer and more vivid to Meno (and by implication to Plato's audience at the same time). The conversation of Socrates and slave explains recollection itself rather than introducing a distinct topic.

Turning to the book's second half, the Skeptics, who are the subject of Fine's last two chapters, are in a unique position with regard to the paradox of inquiry. Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics need to answer the paradox no less than Plato. For all these thinkers, it is crucial that successful inquiry is possible. For the Skeptics, however, the paradox of inquiry is yet another battleground in their war against dogmatic philosophers. Fine shows how both Stoics and Epicureans try to use the paradox of inquiry against Skeptics and how Skeptics in turn argue that the paradox supports them against Epicureans and Stoics. In a nutshell, Stoics and Epicureans claim that Skeptics can't inquire since they don't even know what they're talking about or looking for, and Skeptics respond that <i>only they</i> can inquire since Epicureans and Stoics believe they know the truth. In an argument familiar from Plato's <i>Meno</i>, Skeptics claim that you don't look for knowledge that you already think you have. These chapters make many interesting observations, particularly concerning whether or not the Skeptics think that they can do entirely without belief. But we also learn how flexible the paradox of inquiry was in antiquity. It was not just a puzzle to be solved, but also a weapon to use against your philosophical rivals.

This was, in a way, already true for Meno and Plato's <i>Meno</i>. When Meno first raises the paradox of inquiry, he is floundering as a result of Socratic elenchus. If we consider the <i>Meno</i> as a drama, Meno's motivation at this point in the conversation is to turn the tables: let's see Socrates answer <i>this</i> puzzle. The chapters on the Skeptics make clear that such an eristic use of the paradox is always available. Fine has taken up Meno's challenge and turned it into a valuable opportunity to investigate both the paradox itself and its many wider ramifications.[[5]]
