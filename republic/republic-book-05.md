# *Republic* Book 5

As Book 5 begins, Socrates is about to explain the four bad types of
governments, but Polemarchus interrupts.  Polemarchus speaks to Adeimantus,
and the two of them tell Socrates that he has left an important part of his
case incomplete.  In Book 4 (423e-424a), Socrates said that the people of his
ideal city would live in some sort of communal relationship. Spouses and
children would be shared.  But Socrates did not discuss any details, and
Adeimantus wants those details now.  After a lot of (real or fake) humility,
Socrates agrees.

First, however, Socrates goes back to another issue that he says he left
unfinished.  He asks whether women can be guardians too.  Glaucon says that
they can, but he notes that women are weaker.  Socrates ignores this (for the
moment), and says that if they will do the same job, they must receive the
same education.  Glaucon agrees, and Socrates notes that their position will
shock people.  Socrates presses this point by insisting that women will
exercise naked, just as men do, as well as together with men (451c-453e).

Socrates imagines an opponent who argues that they agreed (i) that people
should do the job they are suited for, (ii) men and women are different, (iii)
different people are suited for different jobs, and therefore (iv) men and
women should do different jobs.  In response, Socrates argues that the
differences in (ii) must be relevant.  For example, a bald man is different
from a man with hair, but this is not relevant to whether or not the two men
are shoemakers.  Likewise, men and women have biological differences, but
these may not be relevant to whether or not women can be guardians
(454a-456c).

Next, Socrates argues that all there should be no individual families for
guardians.  Men and women will be spouses to each other in common, and
children of guardians will belong to everyone equally.  Socrates proposes
a complicated deception.  The rulers will aim to have the best men and women
sleep together and have children, but they will (somewhat?) deny sex to the
worst men and women.  They will also raise the children in communal pens, and
parents will not know who is their child.  Women should aim to have children
from twenty until forty, and men from twenty-five until fifty-five
(456d-461e).

When Socrates discusses the practices of auxiliaries in war, he insists that
they should not take *Greeks* as slaves (469b-c).  This strongly suggests that
they will (as a matter of course?) take non-Greeks as slaves.  Consider the
following section (469c; see also 472b):

>   'Is the best thing, then, for them both to avoid owning Greek slaves
> themselves, and also to advise other Greeks not to own them?'
>   'It certainly is,' he said. 'That way they are likely to turn their
>   attention more towards the barbarians, and leave one another alone.'

Socrates also endorses a proto-racist notion (based on ethnicity) when he
argues for systematically different treatment of Greeks and non-Greeks in war.
Socrates argues that "the whole Greek race is 'his own,' or related" while
"the barbarian race...is alien, and 'not its own'" (470c).

Glaucon interrupts Socrates again.  Socrates falls down a rabbit hole about
war and how the ideal city will behave in war, but Glaucon reminds Socrates
that they have left an important task unfinished.  They still need to show
whether and how to create a city with the kind of communal living arrangements
that they have proposed.  Socrates hems and haws.  He argues that in many
cases an ideal is not (fully) possible, but that it is still useful.  Finally,
however, he says bluntly that the kind of city he proposes will only come to
be if philosophers become rulers or if rules become philosophers (472c-473e).

Socrates then goes off on a long tangent before he says more about
philosophers.  First, he argues that a "lover of X" must love all examples of
X, not just some.  (This seems wildly false to me.)  Then Socrates
distinguishes between "lovers of sights and sounds" and "lovers of wisdom."
In order to make out this second distinction, Socrates brings up the forms for
the first time in the dialogue.  Socrates claims that we can distinguish
knowledge, opinion (or *belief*), and ignorance by distinguishing between
their objects.  Knowledge is of forms, ignorance is of nothing (what does not
existâ€”this is weird), and opinion is intermediate and aims at what does and
does not exist.  These intermediate objects appear to be everyday things.
They exist, but they are changeable and only relatively what they are.  For
example, a beautiful person can become ugly, and they may be beautiful only in
some contexts or situations (475d-480a).
