# Brief notes on life and time of Dante

(I use the Durling and Martinez edition of Dante's *Inferno* as the basis for these notes.)

## Life and Background

Dante Alighieri is born in Florence in 1265. Dante's mother, Bella, dies when he is young, and his father, Alighiero, dies when Dante is around eighteen. Dante is exiled from Florence in 1302. In the 35 years between his birth and exile, Florence more than doubles in population and grows enormously powerful politically and financially. For many centuries around Dante's life, the popes and emperors of the HRE struggled for power. Supporters of the popes were known as Guelfs, and supporters of the emperors were known as Ghibellines. The Guelfs were subdivided into factions called "White" and "Black." Dante was a White Guelf, and he was heavily involved in the politics of Florence. Unfortunately, Pope Boniface VIII helped the Black Guelfs to take over the city, and Dante was exiled early in 1302. Later still, in 1304, Dante abandoned the Whites and declared himself "a party by himself." Dante spent the rest of his life as a guest in various cities in northern Italy. He was an important and famous poet and political figure in his own lifetime, and he dies in 1321 after catching a fever on a diplomatic mission.

## Canto 1

+ Cold opening: Dante gives no traditional proem. He starts in a highly unconventional manner by presenting himself as an Everyman, lost in a literal and spiritual sense, at 35. He will "find his way" over the rest of the poem, but his journey becomes our path to knowledge as well as Dante teaches us what he sees and discovers.
+ The animals: Dante is often a poet of unambiguous references, but scholars cannot work out exactly what the three animals stand for. We can see clearly that the she-wolf is evil and terrifying; the lion seems similar, though we hear less about him. However, the leopard appears to be positive, at least initially. However, we hear very little about her too.
+ Vergil: he appears in the first instance as a poet, not a guide. He asks Dante why he doesn't just go up the mountain, but then clearly says that Dante must go down in order to rise. Is this a mistake or deliberate?
+ The greyhound: maybe Christ or maybe a human ruler who prefigures Christ? Scholars cannot decide.
+ What Dante will see with Vergil: (i) Hell (115-117), (ii) Purgatory (118-120), (iii) Heaven (121-129). (Note the tricolon crescendo!)

## Canto 2

+ Invocation to the Muse
+ The poet's hesitation: humble brag or a true display of the need for grace and external aid?
+ Vergil's speech: in order to give Dante courage, Vergil tells him how they came to meet. It was no accident that Vergil found Dante. A woman came from Heaven to send Vergil to Dante. The woman is Beatrice (more on her below). Mary (the noble lady of lines 94-96) sent Saint Lucy to Beatrice, and Beatrice sends Vergil to Dante. There is a clear hierarchy stretching from Dante and Vergil all the way to Mary, the mother of Jesus.
+ The flower simile: although it is dark outside (we've moved from dawn to dusk within the first two cantos), Vergil's words and Beatrice's act of grace bring light and warmth and courage to Dante's soul.

## Canto 3

+ The gate and its message: god makes the gate and Hell for the angels who reject him.
+ Dante's tears: Dante initially crys at what he hears. Why? Does this express sympathy? Fear? Both?
+ The souls outside Hell: some people and some angels live forever *outside* of hell. These are people who were neither good nor evil; the angels turned away from god but did not join the fight against god. Such souls and angels suffer, but do not enter Hell. They are not bad enough for Hell, and they are not good enough for Purgatory or Heaven.
+ The pilgrim faints: why?

## Canto 4

+ Vergil's pity: why?
+ The unbaptized: just inside the gates of Hell, we find two groups mixed together. The unbaptized before Christ was born and the unbaptized after he was born. Everyone who lives before Christianity is unbaptized, but Vergil seems to say that some of these people "adore God as was needful." Those escape the fate of Hell. In any case, Dante allows that "people of great worth" are "suspended in that limbo." Presumably, he includes both pre- and post-Christians in this group.
+ The harrowing of Hell: a late ancient (3rd century CE) story according to which Jesus descends into Hell and saves some early figures from before his birth.
+ Intellectual elite: some people of great intellectual gifts among these unbaptized are special. They are poets and philosophers, scientists, mathematicians.
+ Dante and the great poets: Homer, Vergil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, and Dante form a group of six at one point. Dante makes a big deal of his joining the group.
+ Aristotle: among the philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians, Aristotle stands supreme.

## Canto 5

+ Minos resents Dante, and Vergil yells at him as he yelled at Charon. The pattern of demons yelling at Dante is interesting. They rebel against the law of god still?
+ He first sees sexual sinners "they who make reason subject to desire."
+ Dido? Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra together? Why the women first?
+ Francesca and Paolo: she was married to his brother, and he was married as well. Thus, they betrayed their vows and their family.
+ What should we think of their attitude towards god and towards Dante (91-93)?
+ They read love stories together; this sparks their affair (127 ff.).
+ Dante faints again.
+ Read final note on 111 and discuss.

## Canto 6

+ Prophecy as history: Ciacco predicts events that have already happened. Dante borrows this technique from Vergil. John Milton borrows it in turn from both of them.

## Canto 7

+ Vergil on fortune (61 ff.)

## Canto 8

+ Dante and Filippo Argenti (31-64)
+ Dante left alone (94-111)
+ The fallen angels refuse Vergil (115-130)

## Canto 9

+ Dante's fear and Vergil's hesitation (1-9)

## Canto 10

+ Dante exiles Guido; Dante will be exiled himself.
+ Prophecy in the poem?
