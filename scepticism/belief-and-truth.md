# Notes on a contrast between modern and ancient skepticism

## Introduction

Scholars often say that ancient and modern skepticsm are different. The following (long) quote is a particularly clear example of what I have in mind.

> [T]here is another and more interesting difference between ancient and modern scepticism. The Greeks took their scepticism seriously: the moderns do not.

> Modern scepticism frequently represents itself as issuing a challenge to *knowledge*. The sceptic argues that, under pressure from his arguments, we must abandon many, or indeed all, of our claims to knowledge and confess that in truth we know very little. At first, that conclusion may seem heady and sparkling; but on repetition it may come to appear flat. For the sceptical challenge leaves all our *beliefs* intact: provided only that we do not claim to *know* anything, we may continue with our usual assertions and persist in our usual beliefs. We shall allow that our beliefs do not amount to knowledge, but we shall insist that we are still justified in holding them. A scepticism of that sort may actually seem a charade. (For is not the sceptic merely stipulating knowledge out of existence by insisting that no degree of justification, however high, is quite enough for knowledge?) It will certainly seem idle. It does not affect our behavior or our mode of life, and it is to that extent unserious.

> The ancient sceptics did not attack knowledge: they attacked belief. They argued that, under sceptical pressure, our beliefs turn out to be groundless and that we have no more reason to believe than to disbelieve. As a result, they supposed, our beliefs would vanish. We should, of course, lose all knowledge; but that would be merely a trivial consequence of our general loss of belief. The ancient sceptics do not claim to *know* that the water in the kettle will boil—but neither do they *believe* that it will boil. Rather, they neither believe nor disbelieve that the water will boil: if you ask them ‘Will it boil?’ they shrug their shoulders—and if you ask them ‘Will it freeze?’ they make the same gesture of indifference (Annas and Barnes, 1985, 7-8; emphases theirs).

Things I think are wrong here:

1. Ancient skeptics primarily attack knowledge, just like modern skeptics.
1. If skeptics attack knowledge rather than belief, they do not take skepticism any less seriously than if they attack belief.
1. A serious attack on knowledge will *not* “leave all of our beliefs intact.” We will not be able to “continue with our usual assersions and persist in our usual beliefs.” Nor will we “insist that we are still justified in holding” these beliefs.
1. An attack on knowledge is not idle. It can certainly affect our behavior and our mode of life.
1. Many—indeed most—ancient skeptics attack knowledge. Where they attack belief it is precisely in order to attack knowlege. And, in any case, the loss of knowledge is no “trivial consequence.”
1. Very few ancient skeptics are so radical that they treat *all questions* as utterly unanswerable. The "desperadoes" of Cicero’s *Academica* treat every question as if it were as unknown as whether the stars in the sky are even or odd, but this is not normal for ancient skeptics.

Key claims from AB, in a nutshell:

1. Ancient skeptics primarily attack belief not knowledge.
1. They are better, truer, or more significant skeptics *because* they primarily attack belief instead of knowledge.

In response, I think (i) they care about belief insofar as an attack on belief undermines knowledge; knowledge remains the primary target; and (ii) if someone cares primarily about belief, this does not make them better, truer, or more significant skeptics.

## Pre-Hellenistic skeptics

### Xenophanes

> καὶ τὸ μὲν οὖν σαφὲς οὔτις ἀνὴρ ἴδεν οὐδέ τις ἔσται
> εἰδὼς ἀμφὶ θεῶν τε καὶ ἄσσα λέγω περὶ πάντων
> εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα τύχοι τετελεσμένον εἰπών,
> αὐτὸς ὅμως οὐκ οἶδε· δόκος δ᾽ἐπὶ πᾶσι τέτυκται (DK 34)

(See Lesher 167-168 for the scope of “ἀμφὶ θεῶν τε καὶ ἄσσα λέγω περὶ πάντων.” He indirectly makes the point that these are equivalent to later skeptical ἄδηλα.)

### Democritus

> ἐτεῇ δὲ οὐδὲν ἴδμεν· ἐν βυθῷ γάρ ἡ ἀλήθεια. (Taylor, D 15 = DK 117)

### Socrates

### Plato

### Aristotle

## Hellenistic skeptics

### Pyrrho and Timon

### Academic skeptics

### Aenesidemus

### Agrippa (?)

### Sextus
