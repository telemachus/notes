# Notes on Aristocles re Pyrrho and early skeptics

**NB**: I’m using the edition of Maria Lorenza Chiesara[^1] for Aristocles.

Aristocles clearly presents his discussion of Pyrrho, Timon, Aenesidemus, and company as part of an epistemological survey. He prefaces the survey by saying that an investigation of “our knowledge” (ἡ ἡμῶν γνῶςις) is necessary since “if our nature is to know nothing, then we should not investigate anything else” (F4.1). He says that there were “ancient” (οἱ πάλαι) skeptics whom Aristotle spoke against, but then he focuses in on someone nearer to himself: Pyrrho. However, since Pyrrho wrote nothing, he will take up the debate by looking at what Timon, Pyrrho’s student, wrote. There is no initial mention of Aenesidemus, though he will pop up from time to time in the middle of discussion of Timon and Pyrrho. On a few occasions, Aristocles gives Aenesidemus his full attention.

We begin with the famous “three questions” paragraph. Timon considers three questions that we must consider if we intend to be *eudaimōn*: (i) what is the nature of things (ὁποῖα πέφυκε τὰ πράγματα), (ii) how should we be disposed towards things (τίνα χρὴ τρόπον ἡμᾶς πρὸς αὐτὰ διακεῖσθαι), and (iii) what will be the result for people thus disposed (τί περιέσται τοῖς οὕτως ἔχουσι).

The answers are as follows.

1. Things are equally indifferent, unstable, and indeterminate (τὰ πράγματα ἐπ᾽ἴσης ἀδιάφορα καὶ ἀστάθμητα καὶ ἀνεπίκριτα), and as a result neither our senses nor our beliefs are true or false (διὰ τοῦτο μήτε τὰς αἰσθήσεις ἡμῶν μήτε τὰς δόξας ἀληθεύειν ἢ ψεύδεσθαι).
1. Therefore, we should not trust them (διὰ τοῦτο οὖν μηδὲ πιστεύειν αὐταῖς δεῖν); instead we should be without belief and unwavering and unshaken (ἀδοξάστους καὶ ἀκλινεῖς καὶ ἀκραδάντους εἶναι), saying about everything that it no more is than it is not, or that it both is and is not, or that it neither is nor is not (λέγοντας ὅτι οὐ μᾶλλον ἔστιν ἢ οὐκ ἔστιν ἢ καὶ ἔστι καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἢ οὔτε ἔστιν οὔτε οὐκ ἔστιν).
1. The results for people thus disposed will be (i) lack of assertion and (ii) then lack of disturbance (τοῖς μέντοι γε διακειμένοις οὕτω περιέσεσθαι πρῶτον μὲν ἀφασίαν, ἔπειτα δ᾽ἀταραξίαν). Aenesidemus says pleasure (will result) (Αἰνησίδημος δ᾽ἡδονήν).
