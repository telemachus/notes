# Notes for Eidolon article

* We should care more that Socrates cross-examines *a slave*. Scholars rarely
  discuss the slave’s status, and when they do, they say awful things.
* See Gordon.[^1] She explicitly notes the irony directed against Meno via the
  slave’s status, but she says nothing about how this would affect the slave
  (135). Socrates insults Meno by clearly implying “See, even a slave can do
  this better than you.” The slave would know this was happening and that he was
  being used this way. Gordon passes over that in silence.
* See also Vlastos,[^2] who has several awful passages about the slave.
        1. “our opponent could very well say that the subject of the
           interrogation is no mathematician, but a household slave; the
           sophisticated use of diagrams by experts is no index to its probable
           use by an ignorant boy” (89-90).
        2. “The boy, let us suppose, freshly imported from darkest Thrace, has
           had to be taught even arithmetic, and from the bottom up” (90).
        3. “Let the slave-boy fail to hit on the solution, as sometimes happens
           even among the socially elect, and then ‘recollect’ it under
           Socrates’ prodding” (92).
* Readers of *Meno* ignore something essential about the elenchus with Meno’s
  anonymous slave: he suits Socrates (and Plato) partly because he is so
  compliant. Unlike Meno, the slave follows instructions and guidance without
  complaint, obediently, and without growing angry or frustrated. We may wonder,
  however, whether the slave is really so pacific. Plato does not give us much
  by way of characterization. He remains a blank for us, but we have no reason
  to think he *is* such a blank. His compliance is not so much Plato’s
  characterization of him as it is a complete lack of characterization by Plato.
  Socrates and Meno matter both as speakers and as characters; we must think
  about them as people in order to fully understand the dialogue. But Plato
  invites us to simply treat the slave as, to borrow Aristotle’s words, “a
  speaking tool.” (Reference needed.)

## Ruling in *Meno*

* When Meno proposes his manifold definition of ἀρετή, he says that a woman
  should be κατήκοον…τοῦ ἀνδρός (71e7). He also says that he can give, if
  Socrates wants it, definitions of ἀρετή for a free man and for an enslaved
  person (ἐλευθέρου, δούλου 71e9, 72a1).
* As his second definition, Meno says that ἀρετή is ἄρχειν οἷόν τε εἶναι τῶν
  ἀνθρώπων (73c9). Socrates immediately convinces Meno to withdraw this
  definition by asking whether this same definition applies to a child or
  a slave. The *reductio ad absurdum* works because of the societal expectations
  concerning who can rule and who cannot. Meno strongly rejects his own
  definition of two seconds ago (οὐ πάνυ μοι δοκεῖ 73d5), and Socrates agrees
  that οὐ γὰρ εἰκός (73d6) for a child or a slave to rule others.
* Socrates refers to the cliché that beautiful boys can boss around others
  (76b7-c2) when he scolds Meno for imposing on an older man while refusing to
  contribute himself (76a9-b1). Key words: ἐπιτάττεις, τυραννεύοντες, ἥττων,
  χαριοῦμαι.
