# Le paradoxe de Ménon et la connaissance définitionnelle

(Monique Canto-Sperber, Revue Philosophique de la France et de l’Étranger,
Volume 181, Number 4, PLATON (Octobre-Décembre 1991), 659-663.)

This short piece is a response to Dominic Scott’s article ‘Socrate prend-il au sérieux le paradoxe de Ménon?’ in the same volume.

## Introduction

Canto-Sperber (hereafter CS) says that Scott’s article gives good reason to reconsider the traditional interpreation of *Meno* 80-86. According to the traditional interpretation, Meno puts a difficult argument to Socrates—an argument that suggests that inquiry is impossible—and Socrates defuses the argument with the theory of recollection. According to Scott, however, Meno uses his “famous argument” in order to express his despair that learning is impossible. The argument itself is of little interest *per se*. We should be more concerned with Meno’s psychology than with epistemology in this passage. Accordingly, Socrates uses the theory of recollection to improve Meno’s emotional state not to answer his argument.

Although CS doesn’t explicitly say so, we can divide her response into two parts. In the first response, CS looks primarily at what I’ll call “Scott’s positive arguments”. In the second response, CS addresses what I’ll call “Scott’s negative arguments”.

## Canto-Sperber on Scott’s positive arguments (response, part i)

CS first argues that Scott’s presentation does not fit the attitude that Socrates takes towards the theory of recollection. According to Scott, the theory of recollection will cure Meno of his “apathie intellectuelle”. However, CS points out that Socrates suffers from no such crisis of confidence and yet he explicitly says (86b-c) that he is among those “qui ont besoin de la certitude (produite par la réminiscence)” (659).

It’s unclear to me whether the passage that CS cites shows what her argument requires. At 86b-c, Socrates does not explicitly say that he is among those who have need of the certitude produced by the theory of recollection. Instead what Socrates explicitly says is the following:
1. If the truth about things is always in our souls, then our souls would (prove to) be immortal.
1. With the result that it is necessary for you to courageously attempt to search for and to remember what you happen not to know (i.e., remember) now.
Scott can argue that the second person here is not generalizing (the verb τυγχάνεις is indicative). In the rest of 86c, Socrates says only that he would fight for the claim that we become better people if we strive to learn than if we take the lazy route suggested by Meno’s argument and give up. Nothing there explicitly puts Socrates among the people who need confidence from the theory of recollection.

This deserves further clarification. In 86b-c Socrates does say explicitly that people “are better and more manly” if they follow the theory of recollection’s implication and believe that they should inquire into things. This is an explicit statement that all people *become better* insofar as they have these beliefs and behave in this manner. However, at no point does Socrates say that he himself (now or earlier) lacked confidence in this path, as Meno had. Insofar as this is the case, Scott has a right to say that Meno has a crisis of confidence that Socrates does not experience.

CS next argues that Meno is not in the state of crisis that Scott describes. According to Scott, Meno experiences profound distress as a result of undergoing a Socratic *elenchus*. He comes to believe that he does not know what ἀρετή is and he begins to wonder whether it is possible to even begin to inquire into anything. However, CS replies that Meno’s position is not so dire as this. She argues as follows:
+ (i) Meno nowhere says that he does not know what ἀρετή is (ii) nor does he lose hope that he will ever know this (660).
+ Meno admits (only) that he is currently unable to talk about virtue, but (i) he blames this far more limited problem on the “bewitchment” that Socrates has put upon him, and (ii) Meno believes that this inability will quickly pass (660).

I find this argument compelling. CS makes a good case for her specific interpretation of Meno’s psychological state. In addition, she leverages this interpretation in order to argue that Meno’s puzzle to Socrates is *ad hominem* and *ad quaestionem*. Meno sets his puzzle specifically against Socrates (who proposes to inquire although he knows nothing about what he inquires into) and Socratic definition. Socrates has set such stringent demands on definition that Meno’s puzzle may have force against *this notion of definition* even if it is not an all-purpose puzzle about inquiry (660). CS has also noted earlier that Socrates transforms Meno’s specific and limited puzzle into an all-purpose puzzle about inquiry and learning (659). According to CS, the version of Socrates becomes the “official version” in the history of philosophy, but *contra* Scott, Meno’s version and Socrates’s versions are not relevantly the same.

## Canto-Sperber on Scott’s negative arguments (response, part ii)

In the final part of her response, CS directly tackles Scott’s arguments that Socrates does not take Meno’s paradox seriously. According to CS, Scott gives two reasons to believe Socrates does not take the paradox seriously:
1. Socrates does not refute the paradox.
1. Although Socrates has the philosophical means to resolve the paradox, he doesn’t use them.

### Why doesn’t Socrates refute Meno’s paradox?

CS agrees that Socrates does not refute Meno’s paradox, but she doesn’t think this matters since he rarely refutes eristic arguments. CS points out that Socartes nearly never refutes eristic arguments in the early dialogues. According to CS, if an eristic argument contains a logical flaw, then it is possible to make that flaw clear. But CS argues taht even this sort of refutation is vanishingly rare in early Plato. In cases without a clear logical flaw, CS claims that Socrates never attempts to refute an eristic argument. Instead, he prefers to avoid “toute forme de débat éristique” (661). CS further argues that eristic theses might be true, or the arguments against them might be good, but that is not what (primarily?) concerns Socrates. In the eyes of Socrates, eristic debate diverts inquiry from the real questions. As such, he avoids it altogether. Thus, it is not significant that Socrates doesn’t refute Meno’s paradox.

### Socrates has means to resolve the paradox: why doesn’t he use them?

CS also argues that Scott is wrong to believe that Socrates ignores available means to solve the paradox. Scott believes that Socrates could have defused the paradox in one of two ways: (i) he might have pointed out that knowledge is not all or nothing, thus weakening the dilemma; (ii) he might have used true belief as a way to boostrap inquiry even in the absence of knowledge. According to CS, however, neither of these arguments would help Socrates.

The idea of partial knowledge cannot help Socrates, according to CS, because this idea is itself “très problématique” (661). Partial knowledge would be “un énoncé vrai (ou...un ensemble d’énoncés vrais) n’énumérant qu’une partie des déterminations d’un objet” (661). However, CS rightly points out that Socrates has rejected such knowledge earlier in the dialogue. Insofar as Socrates insists on a definition that handles *all* and *only* cases of the *definiendum*, then partial knowledge appears to be excluded. (It is not clear to me whether CS reports this as a problem only for Socrates, given his stringent demands on definition, or whether CS also agrees in her own voice that partial knowledge is an inherently difficult concept.)

Socrates cannot appeal to the concept of true belief, according to CS, since this concept itself depends on recollection. Socrates could only appeal to something—at this point in the debate—to solve the paradox if that something was independent of his theory of recollection. According to CS, there is an essential difference between the following two questions:
1. How should one inquire into what one does not know?
1. How should one inquire into what one does not know, but about which *one knows* that one has a true belief?
CS suggests that even the second inquiry relies on (some form of) knowledge, and thus it too is not independent of the theory of recollection.

If CS is correct about the logical interrelation of true belief and recollection, then she appears correct that Socrates cannot use true belief in order to defuse the paradox. I’m not sure that she is correct, but I’m also not sure that she isn’t. (It would probably help to reread Terry Irwin or others who have tried to employ true belief as a means to solve the paradox.)

## Conclusion

CS sums up by arguing that Socrates does and should take the paradox seriously since it is “precisely directed against the demands which Socrates himself has laid out” (662). She begins by listing three moments that precede Meno’s paradox:
1. “I don’t knokw what virtue is; however, not knowing what something is, how can I know what it’s like? I do not know anything about something—whatever it is—if I don’t know what it is.” (71b)
1. “Not knowing what virtue is in general, what can I do in order to recognize it in the small parts of it which you show me?” (79c)
1. “I am in a state of extreme embarrassment, I don’t know at all what virtue is...but nevertheless I want to inquire.” (80d)
CS writes, “Meno’s reaction (to what Socrates says in 80d above) serves to directly attack the conception of inquiry that Socrates has argued for up until this point rather than to express the anxiety of not being able ever to know anything” 662). She goes on to point out that by this point in the dialogue, we know exactly what Socrates means by “inquiry”. Though CS does not say so, this implies that Meno is likely to attack just such an inquiry and not inquiry or learning in general. Thus it is Socrates and not Meno who generalizes the paradox. (This further point is excellent, I think.)

CS concludes “the official version of the paradox is only interesting if one makes a paradox of knowledge by definition out of it: for a partial definition is something whose existence is problematic” (663). She has just shown that Socrates believes several things *about* virtue that have been said so far in the dialogue, but that this does not matter to him. He will not use such beliefs to bootstrap knowledge in the absence of a proper definition. Thus, we have reason to believe that she is correct, and that Socrates is open to a challenge like that of the paradox—both Meno’s *ad hominem* version and Socrates’s more general version.

Although Socrates should take the problem seriously—and he does take it seriously, CS clarifies that he need not—and does not—take seriously the precise way that Meno puts the paradox nor the eristic version that he builds himself. The transformation of Meno’s paradox into an eristic paradox serves, perhaps, as “a means of dispensing with a refutation” and moving on to the theory of recollection. The theory of recollection addresses the deeper problem, but it does not directly refute or address Meno’s exact formulation nor the eristic paradox.
