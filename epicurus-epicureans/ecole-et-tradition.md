# L’épicurisme: école et tradition, Diskin Clay

(in *Lire Épicure et les épicuriens*, edd. Alain Gigandet and Pierre-Marie Morel)

## Les débuts

The name ‘Epicurus’ is relatively rare in Greek, though several disciples of Epicurus name their children after the Master. Clay reminds us that the ἐκίκουροι in Plato’s *Republic* are subordinates who help the Guardians of the ideal city. Socrates mentions these allies near the myth of the division of citizens into metals, gold, silver, and bronze (415 A). Clay notes that for many historians of philosophy, ancient and modern, Epicurus himself has belonged to the race of silver (at best?), while Plato is the race of gold. However, the disciples of Epicurus viewed their master as a universal herald and savior (5).

Epicurus was an Athenian, but he was not born in Athens. In this way, Epicurus was unlike Plato but similar to Aristotle (from Macedonia) and Zeno (from Citium) (6). Epicurus was born in 341 on Samos to parents who emigrated from Athens. He died in Athens in 270 (6). Epicurus arrived in Athens around 307 or 306, during the archonship of Anaxicrates. Among several ancient lives or biographical sketches of Epicurus, the most important is that of Diogenes Laertius. (His work inspired many of the others that we have.) In addition, Diogenes of Oeneanda provides us with two letters of Epicurus which teach us about the early years of his life (6).

## La première génération de l’École épicurienne d’Athènes

We don’t know a great deal about the details of his doctrines or manner of life in Athens, but we do know that he attracted several disciples and students in his lifetime. In particular, he was close with people from Lesbos and Lampsacus, and he remained close with them throughout his life. Clay mentions several voyages to Lampsacus that show up in Epicurus’s letters and that one of his final letters, on his deathbed, was written to Idomeneus of Lampsacus (6-7).

Clay attributes some of the attraction of Epicureanism to the sense of φιλία, which was closer to a family than friendship, in the Garden. He also connects the frequent use of personal letters (with a more public and official message) to this sense of family among the members. He notes in passing that we have letters as far back as 300/299 and as late as 271/270 (8-9).

Epicurus asked his successors and students to memorize his works, but Clay notes that he cannot have meant all of them. Clay insists, reasonably enough, that Epicurus’s *DRN* is impossible to memorize (even *à Épicure lui-même* 10). However, according to Clay, several works from later in Epicurus’s career can be memorized and serve Epicurus’s purpose admirably. Epicurus wanted to ensure the survival of his system, and so he wrote several short letters and his Kuriae Doxae. These do exactly what Epicurus intended: they give followers the basics in an easy-to-memorize manner (10-11). (They also provided Lucretius with the stucture of his *DRN*, according to Clay (11).)

Epicurus also created hero cults in order to help preserve his school and views. Clay objects that these cults are ‘in flagrant contradiction’ to two of Epicurus’s fundamental doctrines: (1) live hidden and (2) death is nothing to us (11). However, there’s no logical contradiction here, and I’m not even convinced that there must be a practical contradiction. Individuals can live their life without concern for death and hidden from the larger political and social community, while still observing community-bonding rituals in festivals for early creators of the school. And the early creators themselves had no idea that these hero cults would be created, so nothing about the cults deformed their motivations or behavior.

Epicurus was smart in his use of religious machinery, whether or not it fit in with his other philosophical beliefs. VS 32 says ‘The person who feels veneration towards the sage enjoys a great benefit’. In Clay’s view, Epicurus made good on this maxim by his use of heroic cult to bind together his Garden, both during his lifetime and after his death (12).

## Les Successeurs

Clay draws attention to a crucial shift in the organization and tone of the Garden between its early days and later phases. Initially, the students were φίλοι and συμφιλοσοφοῦντες. There was no divide in authority or subordination. Philodemus’s *On frankness of speech*, however, shows that individual initiates were assigned to proficients and that the school as a whole was devoted to the ideas of the leaders of earlier days (14). It certainly seems that by the time it was an established school, the Garden and similar Epicurean outposts were run in a highly top-down manner, with all authority ultimately flowing back to the words of *ipse* Epicurus (15). (On that note, Clay says that we can call Epicurus, Metrodorus, Hermarchus, and Polyaenus a ‘four-horse team’ if we like, but ‘Epicurus was indeed their driving force’ (15).
