## Chapter 4: Skepticism of Aenesidemus

### The Ten Modes

After she lays out the key arguments in each mode individually, Stough takes a step back in order to understand their shared structure and force. Stough provides two different ways of understanding the meta-argument of the modes, an A argument and a B argument. (Stough calls each of these a “schema” of the argument’s structure.) I’ll go through each of these here as well.

#### The A schema

> 1. The same objects appear different (different impresions are produced by the same objects) owing to differences in perceptual conditions.
> [2. The real nature of an object is independent of perceptual conditions.]
> 3. We have no criterion to determine the accuracy of one perceptual experience (set of impressions) over another.
> 4. We can say how an object appears to us (describe our impressions), but not what it is in its real nature, i.e., we do not know the real nature of the object.
> (76)

Stough argues that “[b]y far the greatest attention of the Tropes is devoted to establishing the first premise” (76). The sceptics provide an enormous list of examples “to show that perceptual experiences can be made to vary as the relevant conditions under which perception takes place are altered” (76). Stough describes A1 as a factual claim, and she points out that except for the case of other animals in the firs trope, readers should be able to verify the factual claims themselves. In that sense, I suppose, the sceptics don’t take A1 to be controversial.

According to Stough, Sextus frequently mentions “the existence of conflicting opinions and beliefs”, but they are *not* “essential to the main argument” (77). In this way, the focus on conflicting beliefs is “misleading” (77). However, the attention that Sextus gives to such conflicts is also “instructive” since it reveals an assumption that “pervades the Tropes” (77). Here is that two-part assumption: (i) “different impressions...are produced by the same objects...owing to relevant differences of circumstance”; and (ii) “these different impressions generate different (and incompatible) beliefs about the same things, not all of which can be true” (77). The first part of this assumption *is* essentially A1; the second, however, is an additional step—and not strictly necessary.

Stough warns us to avoid two errors when thinking about conflicting beliefs in the modes. First, even though the last two modes focus far more on conflicting beliefs than earlier modes, the last two modes are not essentially different from the earlier ones. The other eight modes do mention conflicting opinions, and in all cases the presence or absence of conflicting opinions (as opposed to conflicting appearances) is not necessary for this argument schema. Second, it is a good thing that the sceptical argument does not rely on conflicting appearances. It is not necessarily the case that conflicting beliefs always result from conflicts in appearances. The oar may seem bent in water and straight in the air, but a person might believe in both cases that the oar is straight. As Stough puts it, “To suppose that our beliefs are exact replicas of sensory experience is naïve; but the main argument of the Tropes...is independent of such a supposition” (78).

Finally, Stough also notes that we should not pay too much attention to sceptical discussion of varying (and sometimes conflicting) preferences and aversions. Like conflicting opinions, these can result from conflicting appearances, but they don’t necessarily do so. In addition, conflicting (or simply varying) preferences and aversions are not the best evidence for conflicting appearances. It is better to rely on “firsthand reports of percipients” when available, if we wish to establish that there are widespread differences in appearances.

Stough explains that although no source explicitly states A2 it “is assumed throughout” (79). Stough says in discussion of A2, “The implication here is that not all impressions of an object can be veridical” (79). That seems reasonable enough, but the actual principle that she offers as A2 worries me because it seems to be a fairly strong metaphysical claim or axiom. We can agree with Stough’s implicit point that something is needed to bridge A1 and A3, but we may disagree with the bridge she offers us. Stough notes that it “would be contradictory to assert that the stick really is both straight and bent”, and she cites *PH* I 88 where Sextus argues as follows:

> ἤτοι γὰρ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις πιστεύσομεν ἢ τισίν. ἀλλ᾽εἰ μὲν πᾶσιν, καὶ ἀδυνάτοις ἐπιχειρήσομεν καὶ τὰ ἀντικείμενα παραδεξόμεθα
>
> For we will surely believe all people or some. But if (we believe) some, we will attempt the impossible and we will accept contradictions.[^1] (Or maybe “we will attempt the impossible: i.e., we will accept contradictions”.)

Perhaps, however, we can supply something less ambitious for A2. Why not simply “it is impossible that contradictory statements about an object are both true”? Or even less ambitious “it is impossible to accept contradictory statements”? (Notice that Sextus doesn’t say anything about truth or the state of the world. The only impossibility that he explicitly signals is that of accepting contradictories.) Or if we want to stay closer to Stough’s argument, perhaps “the real nature of an object cannot be contradictory”. But on the whole I’m not thrilled with giving the sceptics any premise that relies on such a dogmatic-seeming statement about the “real nature” of objects.

A3 and A4 are more straightforward. The lack of a criterion results because no appearance has any more claim to correctness than any other. Stough argues that there is no point saying that we give more credence to, say, waking appearances or appearances in good light.

[^1]: I’m not sure if “contradictory” is the best way to translate or understand ἀκτικείμενα here. Red and blue may conflict, as applied to one object in one sense, but they’re not really contradictory.
