# Doing without objective values: ancient and modern strategies, Julia Annas

This seems (obviously?) true, but I wonder how much we can get from this.
That is, I wonder whether these pre-philosophical thoughts imply or rely on
any particular metaphysics or committments.

First, Annas claims that ancient and modern skeptics about morality and value
“are profoundly unlike.”  She takes it to be obvious that ancient and modern
skeptics use very different arguments when they discuss logic or epistemology.
However, people sometimes think that ancient and modern skeptics both deny the
reality of objective value in similar ways.
