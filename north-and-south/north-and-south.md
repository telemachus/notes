# *North and South* Elizabeth Gaskell

## Volume I

Mr. Hale and Mr. Thorton have a revealing conversation about the classics.

> "But you have the rudiments of a good education," remarked Mr. Hale.  "The
> quick zest with which you are now reading Homer, shows me that you do not come
> to it as an unknown book: you have read it before, and are only recalling your
> old knowledge."
>
> "That is true,—I had blundered along it at school; I dare say, I was even
> considered a pretty fair classic in those days, though my Latin and Greek have
> slipt away from me since.  But I ask you, what preparation were they for such
> a life as I had to lead?  None at all.  Utterly none at all.  On the point of
> education, any man who can read and write starts fair with me in the amount of
> really useful knowledge that I had at that time."
>
> "Well!  I don’t agree with you.  But there I am perhaps somewhat of a pedant.
> Did not the recollection of the heroic simplicity of the Homeric life nerve
> you up?"
>
> "Not one bit!" exclaimed Mr. Thornton, laughing.  "I was too busy to think
> about any dead people, with the living pressing alongside of me, neck to neck,
> in the struggle for bread.  Now that I have my mother safe in the quiet peace
> that becomes her age, and duly rewards her former exertions, I can turn to all
> that old narration and thoroughly enjoy it."
>
> "I dare say, my remark came from the professional feeling of there being
> nothing like leather," replied Mr. Hale.

After Mr. Thorton and Mr. Hale talk,
Margaret avoids shaking hands with Thorton—for the first but not last time.

> When Mr. Thornton rose up to go away, after shaking hands with Mr. and Mrs.
> Hale, he made an advance to Margaret to wish her good-bye in a similar manner.
> It was the frank familiar custom of the place; but Margaret was not prepared
> for it.
>
> She simply bowed her farewell; although the instant she saw the hand, half put
> out, quickly drawn back, she was sorry she had not been aware of the
> intention.  Mr. Thornton, however, knew nothing of her sorrow, and, drawing
> himself up to his full height, walked off, muttering as he left the house—
>
> "A more proud, disagreeable girl I never saw.  Even her great beauty is
> blotted out of one’s memory by her scornful ways" (85).

Fanny reveals something important about conscience and shame.
She cares too much what others think and not enough about her own conduct.

> 'Mr. Thornton!  Does he really find time to read with a tutor, in the midst of
> all this business,—and this abominable strike in hand as well?'
>
> Fanny was not sure, from Mrs. Slickson's manner, whether she ought to be proud
> of ashamed of her brother's conduct; and, like all people who try and take
> other people's 'ought' for the rule of their feelings, she was included to
> blush for any singularity of action.  Her shame was interrupted by the
> dispersion of the guests (165).

After Margaret protects Mr. Thorton from the strikers, she cannot sleep.
She feels shame, but I am uncertain why or at what.

> She lay down and never stirred.  To move hand or foot, or even so much as one
> finger, would have been an exertion beyond the powers of volition or motion.
> She was so tired, so stunned, that she thought she never slept at all; her
> feverish thoughts passed and repassed the boundary between sleeping and
> waking, and kept their own miserable identity.  She could not be alone,
> prostrate, powerless as she was,—a cloud of faces looked up at her, giving her
> no idea of fierce vivid anger, or of personal danger, but a deep sense of
> shame that she could thus be the object of universal regard—a sense of shame
> so acute that it seemed as if she would fain have burrowed into the earth to
> hide herself, and yet she could not escape out of that unwinking glare of many
> eyes (191-192).

## Volume II

When Margaret and her father talk with Mr. Higgins, the book reveals some of its
thoughts about strikes and wages.

> So they questioned and listened.  The workmen's calculations were based (like
> too many of the masters') on false premises.  They reckoned on their fellow-men
> as if they possessed the calculable powers of machines, no more, no less; no
> allowance for human passions getting the better of reason, as in the case of
> Boucher and the rioters; and believing that the representations of their
> injuries would have the same effect on strangers far away, as the injuries
> (fancied or real) had upon themselves.  They were consequently surprised and
> indignant at the poor Irish, who had allowed themselves to be imported and
> brought over to take their places.  This indignation was tempered, in some
> degree, by contempt for 'them Irishers,' and by pleasure at the idea of the
> bungling way in which they would set to work, and perplex their new masters
> with their ignorance and stupidity, strange exaggerated stories of which were
> already spreading through the town.  But the most cruel cut of all was that of
> the Milton workmen, who had defied and disobeyed the commands of the Union to
> keep the peace, whatever came; who had originated discord in the camp, and
> spread the panic of the of the law being arrayed against them (228).

Higgins tells a pointed story about the owner of a mill trying to teach him
economics.

> Yo' needn't trouble yoursel', sir,' said Nicholas.  'Their book-stuff goes in
> at one ear and out at t'other. I can make nought on't.  Afore Hamper and me had
> this split, th' overlooker telled him I were stirring up the men to ask for
> higher wages; and Hamper met me one day in th' yard. He'd a thin book i' his
> hand, and says he, "Higgins, I'm told you're one of those damned fools that
> think you can get higher wages for asking for 'em; ay, and keep 'em up too,
> when you've forced 'em up.  Now, I'll give yo' a chance and try if yo've any
> sense in yo'.  Here's a book written by a friend o' mine, and if yo'll read it
> yo'll see how wages find their own level, without either masters or men having
> aught to do with them; except the men cut their own throats wi' striking, like
> the confounded noodles they are."  Well, now, sir, I put it to yo', being
> a parson, and having been in th' preaching line, and having had to try and
> bring folk o'er to what yo' thought was a right way o' thinking--did yo' begin
> by calling 'em fools and such like, or didn't yo' rayther give 'em some kind
> words at first, to make 'em ready for to listen and be convinced, if they
> could; and in yo'r preaching, did yo' stop every now and then, and say, half
> to them and half to yo'rsel',  "But yo're such a pack o' fools, that I've
> a strong notion it's no use my trying to put sense into yo'?"  I were not i'
> th' best state, I'll own, for taking in what Hamper's friend had to say--I
> were so vexed at the way it were put to me;--but I thought, "Come, I'll see
> what these chaps has got to say, and try if it's them or me as is th' noodle."
> So I took th' book and tugged at it; but, Lord bless yo', it went on about
> capital and labour, and labour and capital, till it fair sent me off to sleep.
> I ne'er could rightly fix i' my mind which was which; and it spoke on 'em as
> if they was vartues or vices; and what I wanted for to know were the rights o'
> men, whether they were rich or poor--so be they only were men (229).

Higgins also explains eloquently the gap between truth in a book and truth in
a person's mind or beliefs.

> 'Well, sir,' said Higgins, rather doggedly; 'it might, or it might not.
> There's two opinions go to settling that point.  But suppose it was truth
> double strong, it were no truth to me if I couldna take it in.  I daresay
> there's truth in yon Latin book on your shelves; but it's gibberish and not
> truth to me, unless I know the meaning o' the words.  If yo', sir, or any
> other knowledgable, patient man come to me, and says he'll larn me what the
> words mean, and not blow me up if I'm a bit stupid, or forget how one thing
> hangs on another--why, in time I may get to see the truth of it; or I may not.
> I'll not be bound to say I shall end in thinking the same as any man.  And I'm
> not one who think truth can be shaped out in words, all neat and clean, as th'
> men at th' foundry cut out sheet-iron.  Same bones won't go down wi' every
> one.  It'll stick here i' this man's throat, and there i' t'other's.  Let
> alone that, when down, it may be too strong for this one, too weak for that.
> Folk who sets up to doctor th' world wi' their truth, mun suit different for
> different minds; and be a bit tender in th' way of giving it too, or th' poor
> sick fools may spit it out i' their faces.  Now Hamper first gi'es me a box on
> my ear, and then he throws his big bolus at me, and says he reckons it'll do
> me no good, I'm such a fool, but there it is' (230).

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
When Mr. Hale visits Mr. Bell in Oxford, Margaret is alone for the first time in
a very long time—perhaps ever.  This scene implicitly teaches the costs of
emotional labor.

> When her father had driven off on his way to the railroad, Margaret felt how
> great and long had been the pressure on her time and her spirits.  It was
> astonishing, almost stunning, to feel herself so much at liberty; no one
> depending on her for cheering care, if not for positive happiness; no invalid
> to plan and think for; she might be idle, and silent and forgetful,—and what
> seemed worth more than all the other privileges—she might be unhappy if she
> liked.  For months past, all her own personal cares and troubles had had to be
> stuffed away into a dark cupboard; but now she had leisure to take them out,
> and mourn over them, and study their nature, and seek the true method of
> subduing them into the elements of peace.  All these weeks she had been
> conscious of their existence in a dull kind of way, though they were hidden
> out of sight.  Now, once for all she would consider them and appoint to each
> of them its right work in her life.  So she sat almost motionless for hours in
> the drawing-room, going over the bitterness of every remembrance with an
> unwincing resolution.  Only once she cried aloud, at the stinging thought of
> the faithlessness which gave birth to that abasing falsehood (344-345).

Again a short while later, Gaskell repeats the idea even more pointedly.

> It was past the usual tea-time when she reached home; but she had the comfort
> of feeling that no one had been kept waiting for her; and of thinking her own
> thoughts while she rested, instead of anxiously watching another person to
> learn whether to be grave or gay.  After tea she resolved to examine a large
> packet of letters, and pick out those that were to be destroyed (347).

When Mr. Bell and Margaret visit Helstone, everything is changed and Gaskell
uses this as an object for meditative philosophy.

> And, somehow, this visit to Helstone had not been all—had not been exactly
> what she had expected.  There was change everywhere; slight, yet pervading
> all.  Households were changed by absence, or death, or marriage, or the
> natural mutations brought by days and months and years, which carry us on
> imperceptibly from childhood to youth, and thence through manhood to age,
> whence we drop like fruit, fully ripe, into the quiet mother earth.  Places
> were changed—a tree gone here, a bough there, bringing in a long ray of light
> where no light was before—a road was trimmed and narrowed, and the green
> straggling pathway by its side enclosed and cultivated.  A great improvement
> it was called; but Margaret sighed over the old picturesqueness, the old
> gloom, and the grassy way-side of former days.  She sate by the window on the
> little settle, sadly gazing out upon the gathering shades of night, which
> harmonized well with her pensive thought.  Mr. Bell slept soundly, after his
> unusual exercise through the day.  At last he was roused by the entrance of
> the tea-tray, brought in by a flushed-looking country-girl, who had evidently
> been finding some variety from her usual occupation of waiter, in assisting
> this day in the hay-field (394).

A little later, the philosophy continues as Margaret cannot sleep.

> She kept choking and swallowing all the time that she thought about it.  She
> tried to comfort herself with the idea, that what he imagined her to be, did
> not alter the fact of what she was.  But it was a truism, a phantom, and broke
> down under the weight of her regret.  She had twenty questions on the tip of
> her tongue to ask Mr. Bell, but not one of them did she utter.  Mr. Bell
> thought that she was tired, and sent her early to her room, where she sate
> long hours by the open window, gazing out on the purple dome above, where the
> stars arose, and twinkled and disappeared behind the great umbrageous trees
> before she went to bed.  All night long too, there burnt a little light on
> earth; a candle in her old bedroom, which was the nursery with the present
> inhabitants of the parsonage, until the new one was built.  A sense of change,
> of individual nothingness, of perplexity and disappointment, overpowered
> Margaret.  Nothing had been the same; and this slight, all-pervading
> instability, had given her greater pain than if all had been too entirely
> changed for her to recognise it.
>
> "I begin to understand now what heaven must be—and, oh! the grandeur and
> repose of the words—'The same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.'  Everlasting!
> 'From everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.'  That beautiful sky above me
> looks as though it could not change, and yet it will.  I am so tired—so tired
> of being whirled on through all these phases of my life, in which nothing
> abides by me, no creature, no place; it is like the circle in which the
> victims of earthly passion eddy continually.  I am in the mood in which women
> of another religion take the veil.  I seek heavenly steadfastness in earthly
> monotony.  If I were a Roman Catholic and could deaden my heart, stun it with
> some great blow, I might become a nun.  But I should pine after my kind; no,
> not my kind, for love for my species could never fill my heart to the utter
> exclusion of love for individuals.  Perhaps it ought to be so, perhaps not;
> I cannot decide to-night."
>
> Wearily she went to bed, wearily she arose in four or five hours' time. But
> with the morning came hope, and a brighter view of things.
>
> "After all it is right," said she, hearing the voices of children at play
> while she was dressing.  "If the world stood still, it would retrograde and
> become corrupt, if that is not Irish.  Looking out of myself and my own
> painful sense of change, the progress of all around me is right and necessary.
> I must not think so much of how circumstances affect me myself, but how they
> affect others, if I wish to have a right judgment, or a hopeful trustful
> heart."  And with a smile ready in her eyes to quiver down to her lips, she
> went into the parlour and greeted Mr. Bell (399-400).

Before Margaret and Mr. Bell leave, Margaret goes back to her house to grab
a flower.  This too prompts philosophical meditations.

> Before they left, Margaret stole round to the back of the Vicarage garden, and
> gathered a little straggling piece of honeysuckle.  She would not take
> a flower the day before, for fear of being observed, and her motives and
> feelings commented upon.  But as she returned across the common, the place was
> reinvested with the old enchanting atmosphere.  The common sounds of life were
> more musical there than anywhere else in the whole world, the light more
> golden, the life more tranquil and full of dreamy delight.  As Margaret
> remembered her feelings yesterday, she said to herself:
>
> "And I too change perpetually—now this, now that—now disappointment and
> peevish because all is not exactly as I had pictured it, and now suddenly
> discovering that the reality is far more beautiful than I had imagined it.
> Oh, Helstone!  I shall never love any place like you."
>
> A few days afterwards, she had found her level, and decided that she was very
> glad to have been there, and that she had seen it again, and that to her it
> would always be the prettiest spot in the world, but that it was so full of
> associations with former days, and especially with her father and mother, that
> if it were all to come over again, she should shrink back from such another
> visit as that which she had paid with Mr. Bell (400-401).

When the family visits the seaside, Margaret spends days and days thinking about
her life to come.  She reaches a profound realization.

> When they returned to town, Margaret fulfilled one of her sea-side resolves,
> and took her life into her own hands.  Before they went to Cromer, she had
> been as docile to her aunt’s laws as if she were still the scared little
> stranger who cried herself to sleep that first night in the Harley Street
> nursery.  But she had learnt, in those solemn hours of thought, that she
> herself must one day answer for her own life, and what she had done with it;
> and she tried to settle that most difficult problem for woman, how much was to
> be utterly merged in obedience to authority, and how much might be set apart
> for freedom in working.  Mrs. Shaw was as good-tempered as could be; and Edith
> had inherited this charming domestic quality; Margaret herself had probably
> the worst temper of the three, for her quick perceptions and over-lively
> imagination made her hasty, and her early isolation from sympathy had made her
> proud: but she had an indescribable childlike sweetness of heart, which made
> her manners, even in her rarely wilful moods, irresistible of old; and now,
> chastened even by what the world called her good fortune, she charmed her
> reluctant aunt into acquiescence with her will.  So Margaret gained the
> acknowledgment of her right to follow her own ideas of duty (416).

After Mrs. Hale has died, Mr. Hale and Mr. Thornton have a remarkable
conversation.

> It was curious how the presence of Mr. Thornton had power over Mr. Hale to
> make him unlock the secret thoughts which he kept shut up even from Margaret.
> Whether it was that her sympathy would be so keen, and show itself in so
> lively a manner, that he was afraid of the reaction upon himself, or whether
> it was that to his speculative mind all kinds of doubts presented themselves
> at such a time, pleading and crying aloud to be resolved into certainties, and
> that he knew she would have shrunk from the expression of any such
> doubts--nay, from him himself as capable of conceiving them--whatever was the
> reason, he could unburden himself better to Mr. Thornton than to her of all
> the thoughts and fancies and fears that had been frost-bound in his brain till
> now.  Mr. Thornton said very little; but every sentence he uttered added to
> Mr. Hale's reliance and regard for him.  Was it that he paused in the
> expression of some remembered agony, Mr. Thornton's two or three words would
> complete the sentence, and show how deeply its meaning was entered into.  Was
> it a doubt--a fear--a wandering uncertainty seeking rest, but finding none--so
> tear-blinded were its eyes--Mr. Thornton, instead of being shocked, seemed to
> have passed through that very stage of thought himself, and could suggest
> where the exact ray of light was to be found, which should make the dark
> places plain.  Man of action as he was, busy in the world’s great battle,
> there was a deeper religion binding him to God in his heart, in spite of his
> strong wilfulness, through all his mistakes, than Mr. Hale had ever dreamed.
> They never spoke of such things again, as it happened; but this one
> conversation made them peculiar people to each other; knit them together, in
> a way which no loose indiscriminate talking about sacred things can ever
> accomplish.  When all are admitted, how can there be a Holy of Holies (276)?

Higgins explains to Mr. Hale and to Margaret that his former boss refuses to
hire people who give money to the union.  He considers that tyranny and refuses
to ask for work.  Margaret reminds him that the union too has tyrannical
methods.  This is his reply.

> "I'll not deny but what th' Union finds it necessary to force a man into his
> own good.  I'll speak truth.  A man leads a dree life who's not i' th' Union.
> But once i' th' Union, his interests are taken care on better nor he could do
> it for himsel', or by himsel', for that matter.  It's the only way working men
> can get their rights, by all joining together.  More the members, more chance
> for each one separate man having justice done him.  Government takes care o'
> fools and madmen; and if any man is inclined to do himsel' or his neighbour
> a hurt, it puts a bit of a check on him, whether he likes it or no.  That's
> all we do i' th' Union.  We can't clap folk into prison; but we can make
> a man's life so heavy to be borne, that he's obliged to come in, and be wise
> and helpful in spite of himsel'.  Boucher were a fool all along, and ne'er
> a worse fool than at th' last" (292-293).

After Boucher's death, Margaret blames the miseries around her on life in the
city.

> "It is the town life," said she.  "Their nerves are quickened by the haste and
> bustle and speed of everything around them, to say nothing of the confinement
> in these pent-up houses, which of itself is enough to induce depression and
> worry of spirits.  Now in the country, people live so much more out of doors,
> even children, and even in the winter."
>
> "But people must live in towns.  And in the country some get such stagnant
> habits of mind that they are almost fatalists."

> "Yes; I acknowledge that.  I suppose each mode of life produces its own trials
> and its own temptations.  The dweller in towns must find it as difficult to be
> patient, as the country-bred man must find it to be active, and equal to
> unwonted emergencies.  Both must find it hard to realise a future of any kind;
> the one because the present is so living and hurrying and close around him;
> the other because his life tempts him to revel in the mere sense of animal
> existence, not knowing of, and consequently not caring for any pungency of
> pleasure, for the attainment of which he can plan, and deny himself and look
> forward."
>
> "And thus both the necessity for engrossment, and the stupid content in the
> present, produce the same effects.  But this poor Mrs. Boucher!  how little we
> can do for her."
>
> "And yet we dare not leave her without our efforts, although they may seem so
> useless. Oh papa! it's a hard world to live in!"

After Boucher kills himself, Higgins wants to move with his family and Boucher's
to the south.  When he proposes this to Mr. Hale and Margaret, Margaret gives us
a very different view of life in the south.

> "You must not go the South," said Margaret, "for all that.  You could not
> stand it.  You would have to be out all weathers.  It would kill you with
> rheumatism.  The mere bodily work at your time of life would break you down.
> The fare is far different to what you have been accustomed to."
>
> "I'se nought particular about my meat," said he, as if offended.
>
> "But you've reckoned on having butcher's meat once a day, if you're in work;
> pay for that out of your ten shillings, and keep those poor children if you
> can.  I owe it to you—since it's my way of talking that has set you off on
> this idea—to put it all clear before you.  You would not bear the dulness of
> the life; you don't know what it is; it would eat you away like rust.  Those
> that have lived there all their lives, are used to soaking in the stagnant
> waters.  They labour on from day to day, in the great solitude of steaming
> fields—never speaking or lifting up their poor, bent, downcast heads.  The
> hard spadework robs their brain of life; the sameness of their toil deadens
> their imagination; they don't care to meet to talk over thoughts and
> speculations, even of the weakest, wildest kind, after their work is done;
> they go home brutishly tired, poor creatures! caring for nothing but food and
> rest.  You could not stir them up into any companionship, which you get in
> a town as plentiful as the air you breathe, whether it be good or bad—and that
> I don't know; but I do know, that you of all men are not one to bear a life
> among such labourers.  What would be peace to them, would be eternal fretting
> to you.  Think no more of it, Nicholas, I beg.  Besides, you could never pay
> to get mother and children all there—that's one good thing" (306).
