# Descartes Against the Skeptics, E. M. Curley

## The Methods

The *Discours* and *Meditationes* have a problem that the *Regulae* does not consider: how to justify our belief in the things that seem most evident (43). Their solution to this problem emplys a criterion of truth via the method of doubt. The *Regulae*, on the other hand, does not use or discuss doubt in a significant manner.

Doubt appears in the *Regulae* in the injunction to believe ‘only what is perfectly known and cannot be doubted’ (*AT* X, 362), but this is *not* the method of doubt. The method of doubt is a resolution to attempt to doubt everthing, according to Curley (44).

Early Descartes is ‘both more and less skeptical’ than the mature Descartes (45). Early Descartes is less impressed by skeptical arguments, but at the same time he is more inclined to see limits to the powers of human knowledge. In later years, Descartes gives more credit to skeptical arguments, but it also far more optimistic about the possibility of knowledge.
