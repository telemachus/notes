## White on Plato's *Republic*

In *A Companion to Plato's Republic*, Nicholas White argues that people often misinterpret Plato's main argument. According to White, modern ethics starts from a distinction between duty and interest.

> They hold that we can set up a contrast between what one ought to do and what it would be beneficial to do, and that once this contrast is set up the next and *only* questions to ask are whether those two things can conflict and which should be chosen if they do. Moreover, once these questions are posed, all of the views thus far outlined agree that the only kind of answer that can be given is to *pick one or the other* as somehow overriding, and to show that considerations of reasonableness or rationality or some other philosophical arbiter come down on one side or the other. Perhaps the most characteristic feature of modern ethical thought is to see ethics as dominated by these questions, and ethical philosophers as forced to respond to them in one of these ways. The picture is of a choice between two alternatives, a choice that must be made in one way or the other unless something can show that the two can never conflict (11).

Assuming all of this as given, contemporary philosophers generally take Plato to be on the side of choosing one's own advantage, though of the sub-type that believes that one's (truest) advantage and the demands of duty rarely conflict (11-12). According to White, this is all wrong.
