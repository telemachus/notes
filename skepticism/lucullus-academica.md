# Notes on Cicero’s *Lucullus*

## Edition, Structure, and Positions

Our *Lucullus* was originally Book 2 of the earlier edition of Cicero’s
*Academica*. Cicero first wrote this work in two books, *Catulus* and
*Lucullus*, and only *Lucullus* survives. Both books are set in 62BCE, and they
take place at the seaside villa of Catulus and Hortensius, respectively. Cicero
rewrote the entire work in order to replace most of the interlocutors with his
nearer contemporaries because they are more plausible figures to talk about
philosophy at this level of detail.

At the general level, Lucullus advances a Stoic position in epistemology, and
Cicero advances an Academic skeptical position. Lucullus agrees that (i) if
there is no apprehensive appearance, then nothing can be known, but (ii) there
are apprehensive appearances, so (iii) there is knowledge. Cicero aims to refute
Lucullus.

More specifically, we can see many layers of a debate that lasted hundreds of
years in *Lucullus*. In his edition, Brittain lays out seven stages (xiii-xiv).

1. Zeno advances the earliest Stoic epistemology circa 340-270, and Arcesilaus
   criticizes this theory circa 275-240.
2. Chrysippus reformulates Zeno’s theories in the light of Arcesilaus’s
   criticisms circa 240-210.
3. Diogenes of Babylon, a student of Chrysippus, defends the Stoic position
   against Carneades circa 170-150.
4. Antipater, a student of Diogenes, attacks Carneades’s arguments; Academic
   skeptics, especially Clitomachus and Metrodorus of Stratonicea, argue about
   the best interpretation of Carneades and his skepticism. All of this happens
   circa 140-110.
5. Philo gives up the radical skepticism of his teacher Clitomachus, and he
   advances a mitigated skepticism circa 100-90.
6. In the late 90s, Philo’s students attack his new form of skepticism:
   Aenesidemus moves towards a more extreme skepticism, and this leads to
   Pyrrhonism while Antiochus abandons skepticism and creates a new school that
   joins Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic elements.
7. In response to criticism, Philo gives up his moderate skepticism in favor of
   some form of fallibilism. He also argues for a new history of the Academy in
   order to support his new position with history. He argues for all this in his
   “Roman books,” which are published circa 88-87. Antiochus and others
   criticize these views during the 80s.

## Introduction

### 1-4: Praise of Lucullus

Cicero praises Lucullus as a general and provincial governor (1-3). Other
writers have praised Lucullus for his military successes, but Cicero adds
that Lucullus devoted himself to literature and philosophy. Lucullus even took
Antiochus with him on some of his time abroad (4).

### 5-9: Defense of Philosophy and Academics

Cicero responds to several potential objections. He argues that there is value
in Greek literature and philosophy, and that great Roman men can engage in these
pursuits, provided they don’t neglect their public duties (5-6). Cicero refuses
to accept that the men he places in the dialogue would not have known enough
about these issues to debate them (7).[^1] In response to criticisms of
specifically Academic philosophy, Cicero claims that (i) everyone always prefers
their own school—i.e., the criticisms reveal bias and (ii) Academics are
admirable because they never stop searching for the truth. Other philosophers
are less critical because they are forced to defend views that they have already
accepted (7-9).

### 9-10: Setting the Scene

The conversation takes place in Hortensius’s villa at Bauli. Hortensius,
Catulus, Lucullus, and Cicero are present. The conversation takes place on “the
next day,” after the conversation at Catulus’s villa which Cicero narrated in
the first book of this edition. (See Brittain xvii-xviii for a brief discussion
of what the *Catulus* contained.)

[^1]: Although Cicero briefly argues that envy motivates people who say these figures lack scientific knowledge of philosophy, he later rewrote the Academics to give it more suitable interlocutors.
