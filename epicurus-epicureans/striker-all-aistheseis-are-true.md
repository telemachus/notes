# Epicurus on the truth of sense impressions

(Gisela Striker in *Essays on Hellenistic Epistemology and Ethics*, CUP, Cambridge, 1996, 77-91)

## Did Epicurus use αἴσθησις or φαντασία and what did he mean by his term?

It is unclear whether Epicurus used the word αἴσθησις or φαντασία, and it is also unclear what he meant by whichever term he used. The word αἴσθησις means different things: (i) “sensation”, that is “the process of being acted upon by a sensible object; (ii) “perception”, that is “the recognition of a sensible object (as in ‘I see a man’) or of an observable fact (as in ‘I see that it’s raining’)” (77-78). By contrast φαντασία usually means “sense impression” or “presentation”, that is “the result of the process of sensation” (78). According to Striker, the big difference is between the first sense of αἴσθησις and all other senses of both terms. While all other uses can be true or false, a sensation as a physical process doesn’t seem truth-evaluable.

Striker argues that Epicurus used αἴσθησις and he meant “sense impression”. She argues that our sources are later and reflect Stoic usage. Epicurus, however, “used αἴσθησις in a way which did not correspond to any of the recognized Stoic meanings of that term, but which seemed to correspond to the narrower sense of φαντασία, in which it is restricted to sense perception” (79). Thus later sources, even Epicurean ones, use the Stoic term in preference to Epicurus’s own language.

Next we need to make clear what Striker means by “sense impression”. Earlier, she writes that a “sense impression” or “presentation” is “the result of the process of sensation”. The idea seems to be this: a sensation is a physical interaction between the world and an animal. The sensation itself is simply the physical process, and it is not truth-evaluable, I think, for Striker. As a result of this process, however, the animal gains a view of (some part of) the world. *This* item is truth-evaluable.

## Does Epicurus use ἀληθής to mean “true” here?

No. Details to follow.

## What argument does Epicurus give for his conclusion?

No ancient source gives a full explanation of how Epicurus reaches his view that all sense impressions are true, so Striker considers two possible routes.
1. He concluded that all sense impressions are true after an analysis of perception itself. That is, he studied how perception works and then reached the additional conclusion that all sense impressions are true.
1. He concluded that all sense impressions are true idependently of any analysis of perception. In this case, he had other reasons for his conclusion and the analysis of perception “was developed later to defend the thesis against obvious objections” (86).
Striker argues for the second view.

Striker offers an argument to support an Epicurean view that “knowledge through perception is possible only if all sense impressions are true” (86). This claim is found four times in Cicero (de fin. I 19.64; ND I 25.70; Luc. 79; Luc 101)[^1]. The argument has three premises:
1. All knowledge must ultimately be based on sense perception (86).
1. All sense impressions have the same status with respect to their reliability.
1. Knowledge must be based on sense impressions that are known to be true.
We infer that some sense impressions must be known to be true from (i) and (iii). (ii) adds that they are either all false or all true. Hence, if there is any knowledge, then all sense impressions must be (known to be) true (87).

[^1]: (i) de fin. I 64: quicquid porro animo cernimus, id omne oritur a sensibus; qui si omnes veri erunt, ut Epicuri ratio docet, tum denique poterit aliquid cognosci et percipi. quos qui tollunt et nihil posse percipi dicunt, ii remotis sensibus ne id ipsum quidem expedire possunt, quod disserunt. (ii) ND I 70: timuit Epicurus ne, si unum visum esset falsum, nullum esset verum: omnes sensus veri nuntios dixit esse. (iii) Luc. 79: Igitur semper auctorem habes, et eum qui magno suo periculo causam agat; eo enim rem demittit Epicurus, si unus sensus semel in vita mentitus sit, nulli umquam esse credendum. (iv) Luc 101: si ullum sensus visum falsum est, nihil potest percipi.
