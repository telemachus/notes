# *Anna Karenina* Leo Tolstoy (translated by Rosamund Bartlett)

## Part One

Stepan must "seek oblivion in the dream of life" and Dolly "drown[s] her sorrows
in [the day's chores] for a while" (6, 16).  There is a parallel but also
a strong contrast here.

See the long description of how Stepan's mind works (8-10) for a vivid picture
of an "unexamined life."

After Sergey Ivanovich and the professor from Kharkov discuss whether "there is
a boundary between psychological and physiological phenomena," we *see* this
boundary be breached in Levin (26).  As Levin goes down to find Kitty at the
skating rink, "the more he tried to calm down, the more breathless he became"
(30).  See also "He could tell she was there from the joy and fear gripping his
heart" and (slightly earlier) "An acquaintance he encountered called out to
him, but Levin did not even recognize who it was" (30).

Re blame, after Kitty rejects Levin, she feels "thrilled" (that he proposed to
her), and "she [keeps] telling herself...'It's not my fault.'"  Nevertheless,
"an inner voice [tells] her otherwise" (57).  Kitty, unlike Anna much later,
does not deny her own guilt.  She responds to this inner voice by praying "Lord
have mercy" over and over before falling asleep (57).  Cf. also Levin who prays
in a similar way when Kitty is in labor.  (TODO: find the page reference for
this.)

When Stepan tells Anna that they hope that Vronsky will marry Kitty, Anna reacts
in a manner that suggests a lot.

> "Really?" said Anna quietly.  "Well, let's talk about you now," she added,
> shaking her head as if she wanted physically to banish something extraneous
> that was bothering her.  "Let's talk about your affairs.  I received your
> letter, and here I am" (68).

Anna treats Dolly kindly and sympathetically.  But at the same time we notice
that Anna is strategic and even cunning when she speaks with Dolly.  For
example, "What touched me most (and here Anna guessed what could touch Dolly the
most)..." (71).  See also these scenes, from later in Part One.

>   After dinner, when Dolly left to go to her room, Anna quickly stood up and
> went over to her brother, who was lighting a cigar.
>   "Stiva," she said to him with a merry wink, making the sign of the cross
> over him and indicating the door with her eyes, "Off you go, and may God
> help you" (74).

> (Kitty) "How can *you* be bored at a ball?"
> "Why should I not be bored at a ball?" asked Anna.
> Kitty noticed that Anna knew what answer would follow.
> "Because you are always the best person there."
> Anna had a capacity for blushing.  She blushed and... (75).

Re forgiveness, see the following.

> (Dolly) "Yes, but would you forgive?"
> (Anna) "I don't know, I cannot judge...No, actually I can," said Anna upon
> reflection; and after pondering the situation and weighing it up in her mind,
> she added: "No, I can, I definitely can. Yes, I would forgive.  It is true
> I would not be the same, but I would forgive, and would forgive as if it had
> never happened, as if it had never ever happened."
> "Well, of course," interrupted Dolly quickly, as if she was saying something
> she had often thought herself, "otherwise it would not be forgiveness.  If you
> forgive, you have to forgive completely.  Well, let us go, I'll show you to
> your room," she said, getting up, and on the way there Dolly embraced Anna.
> "I'm so glad that you have come, my dear, I really am.  I feel better, so much
> better" (73).

When Levin returns home, he wants to better.  Tolstoy comments on this as
follows.

> The study was slowly lit up by the candle that was brought in.  Familiar
> details emerged: deer antlers, bookshelves, the shiny stove with the vent that
> had long been in need of repair, his father’s sofa, the big desk, an open book
> on the desk, a broken ashtray, a notebook with his handwriting.  When he saw
> all this, he surrendered to a moment of doubt about whether he could create
> that new life he had been dreaming about during his journey home.  It was as
> if all these traces of his life had grabbed hold of him and were saying: "No,
> you’ll never get away from us or be any different, but you’ll be just the same
> as you have always been: with your doubts and eternal dissatisfaction with
> yourself, your vain attempts to improve and your failures, and your eternal
> expectation of a happiness which can never possibly be granted to you."
> 
> But that was just his possessions talking, while another voice in his heart
> was saying that he should not give in to the past, and could make whatever he
> wished of himself.  And heeding this voice, he went over to the corner where
> he had two heavy dumb-bells, and started doing lifting exercises, trying to
> instil some vigour into himself.  Footsteps creaked outside the door.  He
> hurriedly put down the dumb-bells (95).

Re guilt and blame, see the following conversation between Anna and Dolly.

> 'Everyone has skeletons in their soul, as the English say.'
>
> 'What skeletons do you have?  Everything is so clear with you.'
>
> 'Oh, I have them!'  Anna said suddenly, and unexpectedly after her tears,
> a sly, humorous smile wrinkled her lips.
>
> 'So your skeletons are funny, not grim,' said Dolly, smiling.
>
> 'No, they are grim.  Do you know why I am going today and not tomorrow?  It's
> a confession which has been weighing on me, and I want to make it to you,'
> said Anna, leaning back decisively into her armchair and looking straight into
> Dolly's eyes.
>
> And to her amazement Dolly saw that Anna had blushed to her ears, to the curly
> black ringlets of hair on her neck.
>
> 'Yes,' continued Anna.  'Do you know why Kitty did not come to dinner?  She is
> jealous of me.  I have spoiled...I was the reason why that ball was a torment
> rather than a joy for her.  But it's not my fault, it really isn't, or maybe
> just slightly,' she said, drawing out the word 'slightly' in a high-pitched
> voice.
>
> 'Oh, you sounded just like Stiva when you said that!' said Dolly, laughing.
>
> Anna was offended.
>
> 'Oh, no, no! I am not like Stiva,' she said, frowning.  'That is why I am
> telling you this, because I will not allow myself even for a moment to doubt
> myself,' said Anna.
>
> But the moment she uttered those words, she felt they were untrue; she not
> only did doubt herself, but the thought of Vronsky gave her a thrill, and she
> was leaving earlier than she had wanted purely to avoid meeting him again
> (100-101).

Again on guilt, see the following.

> The hero of the novel had already begun to attain his English fortune,
> a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was experiencing a desire to go with him
> to this estate, when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed and that
> she was ashamed for the same reason.  But what should he be ashamed of?  'And
> what exactly am I ashamed of?' she asked herself in aggrieved surprise.  She
> put down her book and leaned back in her seat, gripping the paper-knife
> tightly in both hands.  There had been nothing shameful.  She sifted through
> all her Moscow memories.  They were all good, all pleasant.  She remembered
> the ball, she remembered Vronsky and his love-stricken, submissive face, and
> she remembered all her interactions with him; there had been nothing shameful.
> But it was also at this particular stage in her recollections that her feeling
> of shame increased, as if some kind of inner voice was saying to her right at
> the moment when she remembered Vronsky: 'Warm, very warm, hot.'  'Well, then?'
> she said to herself resolutely as she shuffled in her seat. 'What can it mean?
> Am I really afraid to look at this directly?  Well, then?  Can there really
> be, and could there ever be any kind of relations between me and that officer
> boy which might be different to those with every other acquaintance?'  She
> smiled contemptuously and picked up her book again, but now she definitely
> could not understand what she was reading.  She ran her paper-knife over the
> window, then pressed its smooth and cold surface against her cheek, and almost
> laughed out loud from the joy suddenly overcoming her for no apparent reason.
> She felt that her nerves were being stretched ever more tautly, like strings
> on some kind of twisting pegs.  She felt her eyes opening wider and wider, her
> fingers and toes twitching nervously, something in her chest constricting her
> breathing, and every image and sound in this flickering half-light striking
> her with exceptional sharpness.  She kept being visited by moments of doubt as
> to whether the carriage was moving forwards, or backwards, or standing
> stock-still.  Was that Annushka beside her or a stranger?  'Over there on the
> armrest, is that a fur coat or an animal?  And what am I doing here?  Is this me
> or someone else?'  She was afraid of surrendering to this oblivion.  But
> something was luring her into it, and she could surrender to it or resist it
> at will.  In order to try and come to her senses, she stood up, threw aside her
> rug, and removed the cape from her warm dress.  For a moment she did come to
> her senses, and realized that the emaciated peasant in the long nankeen coat
> with a missing button who had come in was the stoker, that he was looking at
> the thermometer, and that the wind and the snow had burst in through the door
> after him, but then everything became confused again…The long-waisted peasant
> started gnawing at something in the wall, the old lady started stretching her
> legs out the whole length of the carriage, filling it with a black cloud; then
> there was a terrible screeching and banging sound, as if someone were being
> torn to pieces; then there was a blinding red light, and then everything was
> shut out by a wall.   Anna felt she had vanished.  But all this was enjoyable,
> not frightening.  The voice of the muffled, snow-covered man shouted out
> something above her ear.  She stood up and collected herself; she realized
> they had arrived at a station, and that this was the conductor.  She asked
> Annushka to hand her back the cape she had taken off, and her scarf, put them
> on, and headed for the door (102-103).

Re guilt and emotional upheaval, see the following.

> She had told herself more than once these last days and just now, that to her
> Vronsky was simply one of the hundreds of endlessly indistinguishable young
> men who were to be encountered everywhere, and that she would never allow
> herself even to think about him; but now, from the first moment she set eyes
> on him, she was overcome with a feeling of jubilant pride.  She did not need
> to ask why he was there.  She knew, just as surely as if he had told her, that
> he was there to be where she was.
>
> 'I didn't know you were travelling.  Why are you travelling?' she asked,
> lowering the hand which had been about to take hold of the post.  Her face
> radiated irrepressible joy and excitement.
>
> 'Why am I travelling?' he replied, looking straight into her eyes.  'You know
> that I am travelling to be where you are,' he said.  'I can't do otherwise.
>
> And right at that moment, as if it had overcome some obstacle, the wind
> hurled down snow from the roof of the carriage and rattled a loose sheet of
> iron, while up in front, the locomotive's low whistle started to wail
> mournfully and gloomily.  The full horror of the snowstorm seemed even more
> splendid to her now.  He had said precisely what her soul desired, but which
> she feared with her reason.  She did not answer, and he saw a struggle in her
> face.
>
> 'Forgive me if what I said displeased you,' he said meekly.
>
> He spoke courteously and respectfully, but so firmly and insistently that for
> a long time she could not say anything in reply.
>
> 'What you are saying is wrong, and I must ask you, if you are a good man, to
> forget what you have said, as I will,' she said finally.
>
> 'I will never ever forget a single word or gesture of yours, nor can I...
> (105).

This passage continues as follows.

> [S]he paused in this small vestibule while she went over in her mind what had
> happened.  Without being able to remember what either of them had said, she
> understood through her feelings that this brief exchange had brought them
> terribly close; and she was both frightened and overjoyed by this.  After
> standing there for a few seconds, she went into the compartment and sat down
> in her seat.  That magical, tense state which had tormented her before had not
> only returned but had intensified, and had reached the point where she feared
> something too taut inside her might snap at any moment.  She did not sleep all
> night.  But there was nothing unpleasant or gloomy in the tension or the
> dreams which filled her imagination; on the contrary, there was something
> joyous, searing, and exciting (105).

After Anna returns home with her husband, she continues to feel ashamed of her
behavior and Vronsky's.  (Vronsky goes out of his way to speak to Anna on the
train platform in St. Petersburg, in front of her husband.)

> The feeling of groundless shame she had experienced during the journey, as
> well as the anxiety, had completely disappeared.  Back in her usual routine,
> she once more felt steadfast and beyond reproach.
>
> She recalled her state of mind the previous day with amazement.  'What exactly
> happened?  Nothing.  Vronsky said something foolish, which was easy to put
> a stop to, and I answered as I should have done.  There is no need to tell my
> husband, nor should I.  Talking about it would mean attaching importance to
> something which has none.'  She remembered recounting to her husband how one
> of his subordinates in Petersburg had once almost made a confession of love to
> her, and how Alexey Alexandrovich had replied that every woman in society was
> liable to encounter this sort of thing, but that he had complete faith in her
> discretion, and would never allow himself to demean either of them by being
> jealous.  'So there's no reason to tell him?  No, and thank goodness there is
> nothing to tell anyway,' she said to herself (111).

Anna explodes in anger at a dressmaker, and she feels ashamed at her own
outburst.

> Having occupied herself with her wardrobe after the guests had left, Anna had
> in fact become very angry.  Generally expert in dressing inexpensively, before
> leaving for Moscow she had given three dresses to the seamstress for altering.
> The dresses needed to be altered in such a way that they would not be
> recognized, and were supposed to have been ready three days earlier.  It
> turned out that two dresses were nowhere near finished, while the third had
> been altered, but not in the way Anna wanted.  The seamstress came to explain,
> maintaining it would be better that way, and Anna flew into such a rage that
> she was ashamed to recall it later on.  In order to calm down completely, she
> went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son; she put him to
> bed herself, made the sign of the cross over him, and covered him up with his
> blanket (112).

Karenin reveals his unforgiving side when Anna talks with him about Stepan and
Dolly.

> [Anna] told him about her feelings of pity, first for her brother, and then
> for Dolly.
>
> 'I do not believe a person like that can be excused, even if he is your
> brother,' said Alexey Alexandrovich sternly.
>
> Anna smiled.  She realized that he had said that precisely to show that family
> considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion.  She
> knew this quality of her husband's, and she liked it (113)

## Part Two

Re guilt for Anna, see the following. (Anna is speaking to Vronsky)

> 'You will remember that I have forbidden you to pronounce that word, that
> ghastly word,' said Anna with a shudder; but she sensed straight away that
> with just that one word forbidden she was showing that she was claiming
> certain rights over him, and thus actually encouraging him to speak about
> love.  'I have long been meaning to tell you,' she went on, looking at him
> straight in the eye, her flushed face burning, 'and I made a point of coming
> tonight, knowing I would meet you here.  I have come to tell you that this
> must end.  No one has ever made me blush before, but you make me feel guilty
> about something' (141).

Re responsibility and wrongdoing, see the following. (Karenin is speaking to
Anna.)

> 'I do not have the right to enter into the intricacies of your feelings, and
> generally regard it as a fruitless and even detrimental activity,' began
> Alexey Alexandrovich.  'When we start digging around in our souls, we often
> unearth something that might have lain undetected.  Your feelings are a matter
> for your own conscience; but I have a duty to you, to myself, and to God, to
> point out your duties.  Our lives have been joined, and joined not by man, but
> by God.  This union can only be severed by a crime, and a crime of this nature
> carries a heavy punishment' (149).

In Chapter 11 of Part 2, Anna and Vronsky consummate their relationship.
Tolstoy's take on this is shocking and remarkable.

> That which had been the single supreme desire of Vronsky's life for almost
> a whole year, replacing all his previous desires, and that which for Anna had
> been an impossible, frightful, and hence all the more alluring dream of
> happiness—that desire had now been satisfied.  Pale, his lower jaw trembling,
> he stood over her and implored her to be calm, not knowing himself how or why.
>
> 'Anna! Anna!' he said in a trembling voice.  'Anna, I beg you! ...'  But the
> louder he spoke, the lower she bowed her once proud, lively head in shame, and
> she crumpled up and started to slip off the sofa on which she was sitting on
> to the floor, towards his feet; she would have fallen on to the carpet if he
> had not held her.
>
> 'My God! Forgive me!' she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her breast.
>
> She felt so sinful and guilty that all that remained for her was to stoop and
> ask for forgiveness; but there was no one in her life now apart from him, so
> she addressed her plea for forgiveness to him.  As she looked at him, she felt
> physically humiliated and could say nothing more.  He meanwhile was feeling
> what a murderer must feel when he looks at the body he has robbed of life.
> That body he had robbed of life was their love, the first period of their
> love. There was something terrible and loathsome in the memories of what this
> terrible price of shame had bought.  Shame at her spiritual nakedness
> oppressed her and communicated itself to him.  But in spite of the murderer's
> deep horror before the body of his victim, the body must be hacked to pieces
> and hidden, and the murderer must take advantage of what he has gained by
> murder.
>
> And so the murderer falls on this body with a malevolence which is almost like
> passion, drags it away, and cuts it up; and this is how he covered her face
> and shoulders with kisses.  She held his hand, and did not move a muscle. Yes,
> these kisses are what have been bought with this shame.  Yes, and this one
> hand, which will always be mine, is the hand of my accomplice.  She lifted
> this hand and kissed it.  He sank to his knees and wanted to see her face; but
> she hid it, and said nothing.  Finally, as if she had to force herself, she
> got up and pushed him away.  Her face was still as beautiful as before, but
> all the more pitiful for it.
>
> 'It is all over,' she said.  'I have nothing but you.  Remember that.'
>
> 'I can never forget that which is my whole life.  For a minute of this
> happiness ...'
>
> 'What happiness!' she said with loathing and horror, and the horror was
> ineluctably transmitted to him.  'I beg you, not a word, not a word more.'
>
> She quickly got up and moved away from him.
>
> 'Not a word more,' she repeated, and she left him with a look of cold despair
> on her face which he found strange.  She felt unable at that moment to put
> into words the shame, joy, and horror she felt standing at this threshold into
> a new life, and she did not want to talk about it and trivialize this feeling
> with inexact words.  But not only could she not find the words to express all
> the complexity of these feelings later, either the next day or the one after,
> but she also could not find the thoughts with which to reflect on what was
> going on in her soul.
>
> She said to herself: 'No, I can't think about this now; later, when I am
> feeling calmer.'  But the calmness she required for thinking never arrived;
> whenever the thought of what she had done, what would happen to her, and what
> she ought to do arose in her mind, she was overcome with horror and drove
> those thoughts away.
>
> Later, later,' she said; 'when I am calmer.'
>
> But in her dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position
> presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness.  One dream haunted her
> almost every night.  She dreamed that both of them were her husbands at the
> same time, and that both were lavishing caresses on her.  Alexey Alexandrovich
> would weep, kiss her hands, and say, 'How good things are now!'  And Alexey
> Vronsky was there too, and he was also her husband.  And surprised by
> something which had seemed impossible to her before, she would explain to
> them, laughing, that this was much simpler, and that both of them were now
> happy and contented.  But this dream weighed on her like a nightmare, and she
> always awoke from it in horror (151-153).

Re love and meaning in life, see the following.  (On this same point, see Wolf,
when she discusses in Chapter 2 why Williams has a strong point that for some
people a loss of meaning threatens any motivation at all, including moral
motivation.)

> [W]hy do they have to pester me?  It's because they can see this is something
> they can't understand.  If this were the usual trivial society liaison, they
> would have left me alone.  But they sense this is something different, that
> it's not a diversion, that this woman is dearer to me than life itself.  And
> that's what they don't understand, and it irritates them.  Whatever our
> destiny is or will be, we have made it ourselves, and we are not complaining
> about it,' he said, linking himself with Anna in the word we.  'No, they have
> to teach us how to live.  They have no idea what happiness is, and they don't
> know that without this love, there can be neither happiness nor unhappiness
> for us—or life,' he thought (186-187).

Re blame, guilt, and conscience, see the following.  (In this passage, Serzyozha
sees as a child what both Anna and Vronsky hide from themselves.)

> The presence of this child aroused in both Vronsky and Anna a feeling akin to
> that experienced by a seafarer, who sees from the compass that the direction
> he is swiftly heading in is far from the proper one, but is incapable of
> stopping the momentum, is with every minute carried off further and further
> off his course, and knows that to admit this to himself would be tantamount to
> admitting certain ruin (189).

Re forgiveness, Anna cannot forgive Karenin because *she* is so guilty towards
*him*.
> 'He's not a man, he's a machine, and a vicious machine when he's angry,' she > added, recalling Alexey Alexandrovich as she spoke, together with every detail
> of his figure, manner of speaking, and character, blaming him for every bad
> thing she could find in him, and not forgiving him anything on account of the
> terrible misconduct she was guilty of before him (193).

Re blame Vronsky is clearly at fault for the injury and death of Frou-Frou,
though I don't understand racing well enough to be sure of the details.

> There remained that one last five-foot wide ditch, filled with water. Vronsky
> did not even look at it, but his desire to win by a clear margin led him to
> raise and lower his horse's head in time to her gallop by working the reins in
> a circular fashion. He felt that his horse was running on her last reserves;
> not only were her neck and shoulders damp, but beads of sweat had appeared on
> her mane, her head, and her pointed ears, and her breath was coming in short,
> sharp gasps. But he knew those reserves would be more than enough to cover the
> last five hundred yards. It was only from feeling closer to the ground and
> from the particularly smooth way they were moving that Vronsky could tell how
> much the horse had increased her speed. She flew over the ditch as though not
> noticing it.  She flew over it like a bird; but at the same instant Vronsky
> felt to his horror that he had not kept pace with his horse, and that without
> understanding how, he had done something terrible and unforgivable by dropping
> back into the saddle. All at once his position changed, and he realized that
> something awful had happened. Before he could work out what it was that had
> happened, the white legs of the chestnut stallion had come up very close to
> him, and Makhotin sped past at a swift gallop. Vronsky was touching the ground
> with one leg, and his horse now began to collapse on to that leg. He barely
> had time to free his leg before she fell on one side with heavy gasps, and
> after making vain efforts with her slender, perspiring neck to stand up, she
> lay there at his feet, trembling on the ground like a wounded bird. Vronsky's
> clumsy movement had broken her back. But he only realized that much later. Now
> all he could see was that Makhotin was rapidly getting away, he was staggering
> about alone on the muddy, unmoving ground, and Frou-Frou was lying there
> before him panting, with her head bent back, gazing at him with her lovely
> eye. Still not understanding what had happened, Vronsky tugged at his horse's
> reins. She again started quivering all over like a fish, making the
> saddle-flaps creak, and managed to free her front legs, but since she was
> unable to lift her back, she immediately keeled over and fell again on to her
> side. Pale, with his face contorted with passion and his lower jaw trembling,
> Vronsky kicked her in the stomach with his heel, and started pulling on the
> reins again. But she did not budge, and with her nose buried in the ground,
> she just gazed at her master with her expressive eyes.
>
> 'A-a-ah!' groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head. 'A-a-ah! what have I done!'
> he cried. 'And the race lost! And it's my own shameful, unpardonable fault!
> And this poor, beloved, doomed horse! A-a-ah! What have I done!  “All kinds of
> people, a doctor and his assistant, and officers from his regiment came
> running up to him. To his great dismay he felt completely safe and sound. The
> horse had broken her back, and the decision was taken to shoot her. Vronsky
> could neither answer questions nor talk to anyone. Without picking up the cap
> that had flown off his head, he turned and walked away from the racecourse,
> not knowing where he was going. He felt desolate. For the first time in his
> life he was experiencing the bitterest of misfortunes, and it was a misfortune
> which was irreparable, and which he himself had caused.
>
> Yashvin caught up with him with his cap, and took him home, and half an hour
> later Vronsky had come to his senses. But the memory of that race remained for
> a long time in his heart as the worst and most painful memory of his life
> (202-203).

Re blame and conscience, see this passage when Anna talks with Karenin, who
shows up on the day of the races and surprises her.  (She has already planned to
see Vronsky that evening, but she nevertheless says that she hopes Karenin will
stay the night.)

> She asked him about his health, and what he had been doing, and tried to
> persuade him to take a rest and come and stay with her at the dacha.
>
> She said all this brightly and rapidly, with a particular gleam in her eyes;
> but Alexey Alexandrovich did not attach any meaning to this tone of hers now.
> He heard only her words and ascribed to them only their direct meaning.  And
> so he answered her simply, but glibly.  There was nothing special about any
> part of this conversation, but afterwards Anna could never recall this brief
> scene without an excruciating feeling of shame (209).

## Part Three

When Levin and his brother, Sergey, speak, Tolstoy contrasts their attitudes
towards life.  Sergey has a philosophical attitude towards his pursuits and
beliefs, but Levin takes a more engaged approach.

> Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and
> education, who was noble in the highest sense of that word, and endowed with
> an ability to work for the common good.  But in the depths of his soul, the
> older he became, and the better he got to know his brother, the more
> frequently it occurred to him that this ability to work for the common good,
> which he felt he lacked totally, was perhaps not a virtue but, on the
> contrary, a deficiency of something—not a deficiency of good, honest, noble
> desires and tastes, but a deficiency of life force, the thing which is called
> heart, the impulse which drives a person to choose one of the innumerable life
> paths open to him and stick to it.  The more he discovered about his brother,
> the more he noticed that Sergey Ivanovich, and many other people who worked
> for the common good, were not drawn with their hearts to this love of the
> common good, but had worked out in their minds that this was a good cause, and
> took it up for that reason alone.  The observation that his brother did not
> take the question of the common good or the immortality of the soul any more
> to heart than he did a game of chess or the ingenious construction of a new
> machine only served to confirm Levin’s hypothesis (243).

Re blame, anger, and forgiveness, consider the following passage.  In this
scene, Levin has gone to his sister's estate to deal with the sale of hay.  For
several years, the peasants have been resisting Levin, and this year they seem
to have tried to pull one over on him.  (Briefly, they divide up the hay when he
is not present, and he thinks that they have not given him his full share.)
Levin insists that they measure out his share again, in front of him.  At the
end of the day, we read the following.

> The women were approaching Levin with their singing, and he felt as if
> a thundercloud of merriment was bearing down on him.  The cloud advanced and
> enveloped him, and the haystack on which he was lying, and the other
> haystacks, and the carts, and the whole meadow and the distant
> fields—everything started vibrating and shaking in time to this wild,

Re vengeance and retribution, see the following.  In this passage, Karenin
considers his options immediately after Anna has told him that she is having an
affair.

> The feeling of jealousy which had tortured him when he was in a state of
> ignorance had ceased the instant the tooth had been painfully extracted by his
> wife’s words.  But that feeling had now been replaced by another: the desire
> that she should not only not emerge triumphant, but that she should receive
> retribution for her crime.  He did not acknowledge this feeling, but deep in
> his soul he wanted her to suffer for having destroyed his equilibrium and his
> honour.  And having once again ruminated over the implications of a duel,
> a divorce, and separation, and once again rejected them, Alexey Alexandrovich
> became convinced that there was only one solution: to keep her with him,
> concealing what had happened from society, and to use every means in his power
> to sever the relationship and above all—and this was something he would not
> admit even to himself—to punish her (286).

While Karenin thinks about how to deal with the relationship between Anna and
Vronsky, he thinks more than once something that sounds to me more or less
Socratic.  Namely, Karenin thinks that he cannot suffer because he has not done
wrong.  This is more or less a version of the Socratic insistence that a good
person cannot be harmed.  See for example, the following.

> I made a mistake in joining my life to hers; but there was nothing bad about
> my mistake, and so I cannot be unhappy.  I am not the guilty party...she is.
> But she is nothing to do with me.  She does not exist for me. ...  I cannot be
> unhappy because a contemptible woman has commited a crime. ...  I cannot be
> unhappy, but neither should she and he be happy. ...  She is bound to be
> unhappy, but I am not guilty of anything, so I cannot be unhappy (283, 283,
> 286, 287).

When Anna first sees Vronsky after telling her husband about her affair with
Vronsky, she does not say that she has told her husband.  She is newly honest
with Karenin, but now (for the first time?) dishonest, or at least circumspect,
with Vronsky.

> 'I saw Vronsky and did not tell him.  Right at the point when he was leaving,
> I wanted to call him back and tell him, but I changed my mind, because it was
> odd that I had not told him at the outset.  Why didn't I tell him if I wanted
> to?'  And in answer to this question a hot flush of shame spread over her
> face.  She realized what had held her back; she realized that she was ashamed.
> Her position, which the previous evening appeared lucid, now suddenly seemed
> not only not lucid, but hopeless.  She started to dread the disgrace, which
> she had not even considered before.  The most dreadful ideas came into her
> mind at the mere thought of what her husband would do.  It occurred to her
> that the steward would turn up any minute to turn her out of the house, and
> that her disgrace would be made public.  She wondered where she would go when
> she was turned out of the house, and could find no answer.
>
> When she thought of Vronsky, she imagined that he did not love her, that he
> was already beginning to find her a burden, that she could not offer herself
> to him, and she resented him because of it.  It felt to her as if the words
> she had spoken to her husband, which she repeated endlessly in her mind, had
> been said to everyone, and that everyone had heard them.  She could not bring
> herself to meet the gaze of the people with whom she lived.  She could not
> bring herself to call her maid, let alone go downstairs where she would see
> her son and the governess.
>
> The maid, who had been listening at the door for a long time, came into the
> room herself.  Anna looked her quizzically in the eye and blushed with fright.
> The maid apologized for coming in, and said she thought she had heard the
> bell.  She brought her clothes and a note.  The note was from Betsy.  Betsy
> reminded her that Liza Merkalova and Baroness Stolz were coming over to play
> a game of croquet that morning with their admirers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov.
> 'Do come at least to watch, as a study in behaviour.  I will expect you,' she
> finished (291-292).

Anna briefly loses control of herself in a remarkable manner.

> She kept repeating, ‘My God! My God!’  But neither ‘my’ nor ‘God’ had any
> meaning for her.  The idea of seeking help for her predicament in religion,
> despite never having experienced doubt in the religion in which she had been
> raised, was as alien to her as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovich himself.
> She knew in advance that the help which religion could provide was only
> possible on the condition that she renounce what constituted the whole meaning
> of her life.  Not only did she feel wretched, but she began to experience fear
> in the face of this new emotional state which she had never experienced
> before.  She felt that everything was beginning to double in her soul, just as
> objects sometimes appear double to tired eyes.  At times she did not know what
> it was she feared, what she wanted.  Whether she feared or wanted what had
> happened or was going to happen, and what exactly she wanted, she did not
> know.
>
> Ah, what am I doing!’ she said to herself, suddenly feeling pain in both sides
> of her head. When she came to her senses, she saw she was holding her hair on
> either side of her temples with both hands, and pulling it. She jumped up and
> began pacing about (292).

After Anna has told Karenin about her affair, when she first thinks about the
future, she imagines every possible misfortune.  She even imagines that her son
will hate her.

> 'Seryozha,' she said as soon as the governess had left the room, 'that was
> bad, but you won't do it again, will you? … Do you love me?'
>
> She could feel tears welling in her eyes. 'How can I not love him?' she said
> to herself, looking deep into his frightened but also delighted face. 'Will he
> really side with his father in order to punish me? Will he not feel sorry for
> me?' The tears were already running down her face, and to hide them she got up
> abruptly and almost ran out on to the terrace.
>
> After the thundery showers of the last few days, the weather was now cold and
> clear. There was a chill in the air, despite the bright sun shining through
> the rain-washed leaves.
>
> She shuddered, both from the cold and the inner horror that gripped her with
> renewed force in the open air.
>
> 'Go, go to Mariette,' she said to Seryozha, who had followed her out, and she
> began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace. 'Will they
> really not forgive me, not understand that all this could not have happened
> any other way?' she said to herself.'
>
> 'Stopping to look at the top of an aspen tree swaying in the wind, its washed
> leaves sparkling brightly in the cold sunshine, she realized that they would
> not forgive, that everyone and everything would now treat her as pitilessly as
> this sky and this foliage' (294).

After Anna receives Karenin's letter telling her to come home and never see
Vronsky again, Anna initially despairs.  Soon after, however, she goes off to
Betsy's croquet party, hoping to see Vronsky.  Anna and Betsy talk about
a couple that seem to be having an infamous affair, and Anna asks pointedly how
that relationship (and the couple's relationship with the woman's husband)
works.  Anna appears to want to know, sincerely and in detail, how this other
couple gets away with it.  Betsy reminds Anna that people don't talk about such
things.  Then Betsy says the following.

> 'You see, I'm in a fortunate position,' she began, no longer laughing now as
> she picked up her cup.  'I understand you, and I understand Liza.  Liza is one
> of those naive creatures, like children, who do not understand what is good
> and what is bad.  At least she didn't understand when she was very young.  And
> now she knows that this inability to understand suits her.  Now she perhaps
> deliberately does not understand,' said Betsy, with a subtle smile.  'But it
> still suits her.  You see, you can look at something tragically and turn it
> into a source of misery, and you can look at the very same thing in a simple
> and even carefree way.  Maybe you have a tendency to look at things too
> tragically.'
>
> 'How I would like to know others as I know myself,' said Anna seriously and
> thoughtfully.  'Am I worse than others or better?  I think I'm worse (302).

When Vronsky takes a morning to "do the laundry," as he calls it, Tolstoy shows
us more about Vronsky's inner life.  He has rules, but beyond the limits of
these rules, he finds himself quickly lost.

> Vronsky's life was particularly fortunate in that he had a code of rules which
> unequivocally defined everything that should and should not be done.  This
> code of rules encompassed a very small set of conditions, but the rules were
> unequivocal, and since Vronsky never ventured beyond these conditions, he
> never had a moment's hesitation about what he ought to do.  These rules
> determined unequivocally that one must pay a card-sharper but need not pay
> a tailor; that one must not lie to men, but to women one may; that one must
> never deceive anyone, but a husband one may; that an insult can never be
> pardoned, but one may insult others, and so on.  These rules may all have been
> senseless and bad, but they were unequivocal, and by adhering to them Vronsky
> felt that he was in control and could hold his head up high.  It was only very
> recently with respect to his relationship with Anna that Vronsky had begun to
> feel that his code of rules did not quite define all conditions, and that the
> future presented difficulties and areas of doubt through which Vronsky could
> no longer find a guiding thread (308-309).

Sviyazhsky is a fascinating character.  He is bright, liberal, and fundamentally
good.  But at the same time, Tolstoy seems to insist that there is something
deeply empty about him.  He does everything right, but also (perhaps) just for
show.  I am not sure.  In any case, Tolstoy makes a sharp jab about people and
their interest in the news when Levin goes into Sviyazhsky's library to pick up
some books.  Sviyazhsky sees Levin looking at a journal, and he tells Levin
about a good article in that issue.

> 'What are you looking at?' he said to Levin, who was standing by the round table leafing through the journals.
>
> 'Oh yes, there's a very interesting article in there,' Sviyazhsky said about
> the journal Levin was holding in his hands.  'It turns out', he added, 'that
> the chief culprit in the partition of Poland was not Frederick at all.  It
> turns out ...'
>
> And with his characteristic clarity, he gave a brief account of these new,
> very important and interesting revelations.  Although Levin was now mostly
> preoccupied with thoughts about farming, he wondered as he listened to
> Sviyazhsky: 'What goes on inside his head?  And why on earth is he interested
> in the partition of Poland?'  When Sviyazhsky finished, Levin could not help
> asking: 'So what does all this mean?'  Nothing, it transpired.  It was just
> the 'it turns out that' which was interesting.  But Sviyazhsky did not
> explain, and did not deem it necessary to explain why he found it
> interesting (339-340).

Re what is wrong with Sviyazhsky, Tolstoy says the following.

> Levin saw that he never was going to find the connection between this man’s
> life and his thoughts.  He was clearly not in the least bit concerned where
> thought-processes would lead; he was only concerned with the thought-process
> itself.  And he did not like it when his thought-process led him up a blind
> alley.  That was the only thing he disliked and tried to avoid, by changing
> the conversation to something pleasant and amusing (341).

When Levin's brother, Nikolay, comes to visit, Levin comes face to face with his
own mortality in a striking and new way.

> They both now had only one thought on their minds: Nikolay's illness and approaching death, suppressing everything else.  But neither of them dared talk about it, and so everything they said, since they did not express the one thought that occupied them, was a lie.  Levin had never been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed.  Never with any stranger or on any formal visit had he been as unnatural and false as he had been that evening.  And his awareness of this unnatural behaviour, and the self-reproach it caused, made him even more unnatural.  He wanted to weep over his beloved, dying brother, and he had to listen and keep up a conversation about how he was going to live.
> ...
> His brother went to bed, and whether he was sleeping or not, being a sick man
> he tossed about and coughed, and when he could not clear his throat he
> muttered something.  Sometimes, when he was finding it hard to breathe, he
> would say: 'Oh, my God!'  And at other times, when he was choking on phlegm,
> he would exclaim angrily: 'Ah, the devil!'  Levin lay awake for a long time
> listening to him.  His thoughts were disparate in the extreme, but they all
> ended with the same thing: death.
>
> Death, the inevitable end of everything, confronted him for the first time
> with irresistible force.  And this death, which was there, in this beloved
> brother, groaning in his sleep and from force of habit indiscriminately
> invoking first God then the devil, was not nearly as remote as it had seemed
> to him before.  It was in him too—he could feel it.  If not today, then
> tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, then in thirty years—did it really matter when?
> But what this inevitable death was, he not only did not know and had never
> thought about, but also did not feel competent or bold enough to think about.
>
> 'I'm working, I want to achieve something, but I forgot that it will all end,
> that there is—death.'
>
> He sat hunched up on his bed in the darkness, with his arms around his knees, and thought, holding his breath from all the concentration.  But the more he concentrated, the more apparent it became to him that this was unmistakably the case, that he really had forgotten, overlooked, one small factor in life—that death would come along and everything would end, that it was not worth even starting anything, and there was no way this could be helped.  Yes, it was awful, but that is how it was.
>
> 'But I am still alive.  So what should I do now, what exactly should I do?' he
> said with desperation.  He lit a candle, got up carefully, went over to the
> mirror, and started looking at his face and hair.  Yes, there were grey hairs
> about his temples.  He opened his mouth.  His back teeth were beginning to
> decay.  He bared his muscular arms.  Yes, he had a lot of strength.  But
> Nikolenka, who was lying there breathing with what remained of his lungs, also
> used to have a healthy body once.  And all of a sudden he remembered how they
> would go to bed when they were children, waiting for Fyodor Bogdanich to leave
> the room so they could start throwing pillows at each other and laugh, laugh
> so uncontrollably that even their fear of Fyodor Bogdanich could not stop that
> overflowing, effervescent sense of the happiness of life.  'And now there is
> this lop-sided, hollow chest ... And I, not knowing what will become of me and
> why ...'
> ...
> Levin ... went behind the screen and put out the candle, but still could not
> sleep for a long time.  The question of how to live had only just become
> a little clearer to him when he was confronted with a new, insoluble
> problem—death.
>
> 'So he's dying, so he'll die before spring, so how can I help him?  What can
> I say to him?  What do I know about it?  I had forgotten it even existed”
> (352-353).
