# Plato beyond the obvious three

We will certainly read *Euthyphro*, *Defense speech of Socrates*, and *Crito*,
but Nails points out that two other dialogues are relevant: *Theaetetus* and
*Phaedo*.

## *Theaetetus*

Nails selects four passages from *Theaetetus* as relevant to the trial and death
of Socrates.

1. Socrates as midwife (148e-151d)
1. The discussion of Protagorean relativism (no exact references given)
1. The “philosophical digression” (172c-177c)
1. The jury discussion (201a-c)

I should include 1, 2, and 4 in my photocopy packet.
