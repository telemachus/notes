# Preface

Philosophy begins, for Shields, "in a specific time and place: in Greece, along the coast of Asia Minor, during the late sixth century BC" (ix). That said, he thinks that philosophy made "only small steps forward at first" and that it "flowered quickly, in some ways astonishingly quickly" with Socrates (ix). As Shields puts it:

> Somehow this one man seems almost single-handedly to have transformed a loosely knit set of far-reaching questions about the character and direction of human existence into a discipline with its own distinctive aims and methods (ix).

Socrates asks questions and pursues inquiries that are not unique to philosophy (Shields notes that "tragedians and epic poets" were concerned with many of the same issues as Socrates), but he "introduced a distinctively philosophical approach, *an analytical approach*" to these questions (ix, Shields's emphasis).

## Scope and aims

+ The book tries to provide an encounter with the kind of philosophy that Socrates introduced to Greece.
+ The book is not meant to substitute for reading original texts.
+ The book doesn't assume that ancient thinkers and their ideas have been superseded.
+ The book doesn't try to dress up ancient arguments in order to make them seem more contemporary.
+ However, the book treats ancient views as *real* options. Where they go wrong, the book says so. Where they are defensible, the book says so.
