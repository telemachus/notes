# I General Doubt

W[ilson] makes many interesting points in her discussion of the first meditation, but I want to pick out three. First, she argues forcefully that the dreaming argument does not suggest that we cannot tell if we are awake or not. Second, she has a very productive way of viewing the doubts in the first meditation generally. Third, she raises troubling but useful questions concerning the connection between doubt and action.


## How does the dreaming argument work?

W argues that a very common reconstruction of the dreaming argument, according to which the argument suggests that we can never be certain we are awake, is mistaken. W’s argument, briefly, is that the common view doesn’t reach the conclusion that Descartes wants. According to W Descartes hopes to conclude that we cannot “know with certainty that the senses ever afford us truth at all (apart from the reality of simples)” (18). An argument that we cannot ever be certain whether we are awake or asleep will not yield this conclusion, or at least W argues that it will not. Therefore, W offers an alternative.

On W’s view Descartes argues that dreaming shows us that ordinary perception may be “thoroughly delusory” because dreaming is relevantly like ordinary perception. Her reconstruction runs as follows (22):

1. I believe I have in the past dreamed that, for example, I was sitting in a chair (with no feeling of sensory limitation, etc.), when it was false that I was sitting in a chair.
1. If I see no certain marks to distinguish the present occasion from past occasions when I believe I was deceived, I have reason to believe I may be on the present occasion deceived.
1. I see no certain marks to distinguish the present occassion from such past occasions.
1. I have reason to suppose I may be deceived in my present belief that I am sitting in a chair.

This argument can be generalized in order to “reach the final conclusion Descartes wants” (22-23).

1. I believe in the past I have dreamed that I was perceiving various physical objects at close range when it was false that I was really perceiving any such objeccts (when my experience was thoroughly delusory).
1. If I see no certain marks to distinguish waking experience of physical objects from dream experience when, I believe, I was deceived, I have reason to believe my waking experience too may be deceptive.
1. I see no such certain marks to distinguish waking experience from dreams.
1. Therefore, I have reason to suppose that waking experience too may be deceptive (thoroughly delusory).
1. But if I have reason to suppose my waking experience may be deceptive (thoroughly delusory), I have reason to doubt the existence of physical objects (for at present we are supposing this experience to be the best foundation for our belief in physical objects).

W summarizes thus:

> Here the source of doubt is not located in the problem of knowing one is awake; it is rather expressed in the claim that I cannot say *why I should unquestioningly regard waking experience of physical objects as real or veridical, when there are no marks to distinguish it from the ‘illusions of dreams’* (23).

At the same time, W admits that her reading of the evidence does not fit *all* of what Descartes says about dreams. However, she points out that the common reconstruction has the same problem: it fits some but not all the evidence. Nevertheless, she feels that her alternative is the better option, primarily because it reaches the right conclusion.

## What principle does the first meditation attack?

W also provides an alternative target for the first meditation as a whole. According to Harry Frankfurt, the first meditation attacks various versions of one principle, namely a principle that determines when sensory evidence is sufficient for belief (38). W goes on to describe Frankfurt’s interpretation this way: for Frankfurt, “the main point of the First Meditation [is] taht the senses by themselves do not provide adequate ‘evidence’ for a firm ‘foundation of the sciences’” (39). By contrast, W argues for a “*causal*, rather than an evidential, interpretation” (41, her emphasis).

> The successive arguments are meant to undermine the confident assumption that the causes of our perceptions and beliefs are truth-conferring. Thus, the example of ordinary sensory illusion reminds us that a perception supporting our belief in a proposition like ‘there is a round tower’ is sometimes generated under circumstances independent of the truth of the proposition; in these cases, the causal chain involved in normal perception suffers more or less minor and local distortion. The Dreaming Argument purports to remind us how *radically* delusive experience can be—that a global and not merely local disruption is possible. In other words, it reminds us that the causal chain generating a particular belief-complex can be quite different from one which, we suppose, under normal waking circumstances results in our beliefs being true. This is enough to insinuate some doubt about the generation of perceptual beliefs under normal waking circumstances. It does not, however, bring into question the assumption that there is *some* truth-bestowing connection between the causes of our experiences or beliefs and their content, if we restrict ourselves to very minimal commitments about the nature of reality. Finally, the Deceiver Hypothesis is introduced to sever *all* truth-conveying connection between perceptions or beliefs and their causes, and to give color to the supposition that beliefs are generated in such a way as to guarantee their falsity. (It is worth noting, in this connection, that the ‘reasons for doubt’ that Descartes offers take us further and further away from the ordinary and natural; they reflect as well as produce the process of ‘withdrawal from sense’ (41, her emphases).
