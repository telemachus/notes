# Brief life of Descartes

## Basics

René Descartes was born on March 31, 1596 in La Haye, a small town near Tours in west-central France. Joachim Descartes, his father, was a magistrate in the regional Parliament in Brittany. Jeanne Descartes (née Brochard), Descartes’ mother, also had family who worked as lawyers or magistrates for the *présidial* of Poitiers. Joachim was away for part of every year for work, and Jeanne died when René was only a year old. As a result, René’s grandmother, also Jeanne, raised him in Châtellerault, a nearby town. (Or perhaps his uncle raised him?)

Descartes was a sickly child. He might have started school as early as 1604, but didn’t begin until 1607. And even once he was there, he had a special dispensation to sleep in late every morning.

After eight years at La Flèche, Descartes went to university at Poitiers, where he received a law degree. But instead of practicing law, he left for Holland in 1618, and he joined the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau (a Protestant). It’s not clear what he did in the army, but he doesn’t seem to have been active in battle. It was more an opportunity to travel for a young nobleman. Later Descartes joined the army of Maximilian in Germany.

Isaac Beeckman, whom Descartes met in 1618 in Breda, had a great influence on the young Descartes. Beeckman seems to have sparked, or at least guided, Descartes’ serious interest in math and science. They were very close for the next ten years, and Descartes dedicated his first book (on music) to Beeckman. More importantly, Beeckman helped to set Descartes on the path that he followed for the rest of his life.

In November of 1619, Descartes had a life-changing experience. While alone in winter quarters, he spent a day intensely thinking, following by a night of three vivid, powerful dreams. Afterwards, he felt inspired to pursue a grant plan for a universal science that would encompass philosophy, mathematics, and the natural sciences. He began work on the *Regulae* around this time. He worked on it for ten years, but never published it in his lifetime.

By 1625, Descartes is back in France where he lives until 1628. In Paris, he becomes friendly with Father Marin Mersenne, who remains Descartes chief correspondent and connection to France until Mersenne’s death in 1648. He also meets many people who are involved in science, literature, and religious debates in France. He was active in the intellectual scene there and impressed many.

In 1628, Descartes moved to the Netherlands where he lived for the next twenty years. (He moved around a great deal within the Netherlands.) He later claimed that he was seeking solitude in order to work. In 1635, he had a child with a maidservant, Helena. The child died in 1640, and Descartes took it quite hard.

In 1647 Descartes returned to Paris to receive a royal pension. This may show that he was no longer as financially independent as he had been. In the end, he never received any of the money he was initially promised (because of civil wars in France), and soon after he moved to Sweden at the invitation of Queen Christina. He was to tutor Christina herself in philosophy, but he contracted pneumonia and died in February of 1650. (February 11th, to be precise.)

## Education

Descartes attended the Collège Royal Henry-IV de La Flèche (often called the Collège de La Flèche) for eight years. The exact dates are unsure, but the modern consensus is that he started in 1607, when he was 10, and left in 1615. The school was founded and run by Jesuits, and it provided an excellent although very traditional education. While we don’t know the exact course of studies that Descartes followed, we know a great deal about Jesuit schools of the time. The first five or six years were devoted to the humanities. Three years were spent on training in Latin and ancient Greek, followed by another year or two reading literature and studying rhetorical technique. Students read Cicero, Vergil, Horace, Ovid and Seneca. The next three years were devoted to philosophy, broadly understood. A year of logic was followed by a year combining physics (i.e. natural science) and mathematics; the final year was devoted to metaphysics and ethics. Mathematics was often focused on applied problems in engineering, and physics at this time still came from a study of Aristotle’s texts from nearly 2000 years earlier.
