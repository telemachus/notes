# Augustinisme et cartésianisme Geneviève Lewis(-Rodis)

*Augustinus Magister*, Congrès International Augustinien, Paris, 21-24 Septembre 1954, Communications, Études Augustiniennes, Paris, V 2, 1087-1104

After a careful history where she traces contemporary awareness of places where Descartes echoes Augustine (1087-1093), Lewis argues that two things separate Descartes from Augustine: (i) his demand for clear and exact demonstrations of the truth and (ii) his careful distinction between reason and faith, together with his avoidance of theology (1093).

On the other side, Lewis finds three areas where Descartes expresses what she calls ‘en authentique augustinien’: (i) when he focuses on the priority and the strength of the criterion that the soul itself understands itself, (ii) when he affirms that the soul is better known than the body, and (iii) when he argues that the path to (a proof of?) god goes through thought, i.e. through the soul and intellect as in (i) and (ii) (1093).

However, Lewis wonders whether these three pieces of Augustinian metaphysics could have been so clearly marked off if Descartes had not first clarified them (1094). She suggests the same idea earlier in the piece as well (1090).

She concludes by acknowledging the areas of overlap between Descartes and then arguing to minimize their importance. Yes, Augustine advanced an argument for existence against sceptics using (some form of) the *cogito*. Yes, Augustine affirms that the soul knows itself and that it knows itself better than any knowledge of bodies. However, Augustine advances these claims as part of an explicitly religious project based on faith and teh requirement of god’s grace to reach knowledge. In addition, he is also aware of the soul’s abundant capacity for self-deception. Augustine himself did not clarify and distinguish these strands of thought. It was only after thinking about Augustine in the light of Descartes that readers in the seventeenth centruy could make the connections they made.
