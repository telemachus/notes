# ‘Scepticism and Modernity’, Richard H. Popkin

(in *The Rise of Modern Philosophy*, ed. Tom Sorell, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993, 15-32)

## Introduction

> Central issues in modern thought such as the epistemological basis of certitude, the kinds of evidence that can be obtained to support basic beliefs such as the existence of an external world, were proposed in the initial Renaissance presentations of ancient scepticism by Montaigne and his followers. The attempts during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to establish a *modern* philosophy from Descartes to Kant can be seen as basic attempts to answer the challenge of modern scepticism, or to live with it (15).

Popkin also believes that the religious confrontation involved in the Reformation and Counter-Reformation helped to spark a ‘sceptical crisis that eroded previous ways of dealing with intellectual issues’ (15).

## Religious debates

Scepticism began to appear in fifteenth and sixteenth century religious debates. Erasmus took a sceptical approach on free will, only to have Luther respond ‘The Holy Ghost is not a sceptic’ (17).

Popkin points in particular to Reformation-era debates between Calvinists and Counter-Reformers. Luther and Calvin rejecting traditional authority, and they opened up the idea of subjective truth. Each individual must find truth for themselves using ‘[c]onscience’ and the ‘inner light’ (17). However, Counter-Reformers could turn this attack back on the Reformers: How can you guarantee that your criterion works? How can you ‘tell the difference between...personal feelings and the purported operations of the Holy Spirit’ (17). I.e., the criterion (subjective feeling) itself requires a criterion. This is a standard skeptical move.

One of the earliest uses of skepticism was to protect Catholicism and stop the growth of Calvinism in France (17). When Gentian Hervet produced a translation of the *Outlines of Scepticism* and the books *Against the learned*, he claimed to have done so in order to defend against Calvinism. Since nothing can be known, Calvinism cannot be known. And we should stick to Catholicism since skepticism argues for tradition in the face of what is unknown.

Montaigne and Charron make explicit attacks like this as well. They use Sextus, explorer narratives, medicine, astronomy, and political history in order to argue that nothing can be known. Any attempt to provide a firm base for knowledge is subject to (i) infinite regress or (ii) circularity. Only god can provide first principles, and thus we must rely on faith. Until we are given such revelation (since it appears not yet to have happened?), we must suspend judgment and stick to hte laws, custom, and religion of one’s place of birth. This defends Catholicism since it is already the traditional religion of France (18). According to Popkin, a ‘sceptical fideistic’ theology became the virtual official theology of French Catholics in the seventeenth century (19).

Non-Catholics turned the skeptical attack back on Catholics themselves. What was the basis for *their* beliefs? If they said the authority of the pope, Protestants asked (i) how can we know who is the pope? and (ii) how can the current pope himself be sure of his status and authority? The use of skepticism from Catholic and Protestant alike went on for over a hundred years (19).

After all of this back and forth, Pierre Bayle, in his *Historical and Critical Dictionary* (1697-1702), argued that anyone who held any religious position did so only as a result of faith. He remained true to Montaigne’s fideism, but as Popkin says ‘It was just a short step from Bayle’s sceptical fideism to a scepticism without any religious faith, the modern attitude regarding religion that flowered in the Enlightenment’ (19).

In addition to battles between Catholics and Protestants, Protestants used skeptical arguments when they began to argue more among themselves. After Miguel Servetus denied the Trinity, Calvin said he should be killed. In response, Sebastian Castellio defended Servetus with skepticism, arguing that ‘dogmatic certainty was not attainable, and that one should tolerate differing views’ (20). Note also how this feeds into eventual tolerance in the age of Reformation, though politics and a need for survival helped too, of course.

## Philosophical skepticism

Skepticism’s role was not limited to religion; it also directly challenged scholasticism, as well as other philosophical views of the time. The traditional philosophy of Aristotle was attacked, but so were new philosophies developed in the Renaissance. In fact, as in Sextus and Cicero, philosophers began to challenge any possible criterion and ‘any human means of justifying knowledge claims’ (20).

Francisco Saches, a cousin of Montaigne and a professor of Philosophy and later Medicine, developed a form of ‘mitigated skepticism’. He attacked Plato and Aristotle, but argued for a limited kind of knowledge. Sanches argued for a scientific method based on evidence. Here’s how it worked:

1. Gather empirical data.
1. Make generalizations from that data.
1. Test the generalizations with further facts.

This method would yield a provisional or limited knowledge, while still accepting the basic truth of global skepticism. We will never know reality as it truly is, but we can make observations about how things appear at specific times and places and build on these. Along the way, Sanches appears to have been the first to use the term ‘scientific method’. Gassendi and Mersenne built on this mitigated or limited skepticism (21).

According to Popkin, Gassendi and Mersenne are forerunners of modern science. They grant that ‘scepticism, in a fundamental sense’ cannot be answered, but they reply that ‘for practical scientific purposes’, we can ignore skepticism and our own lack of essential, fundamental truth. This view, in one form or another, was taken up by Grotius, Hobbes, the Royal Society, and many Enlightenment philosphers. It thus became ‘a crucial part of the modern scientific outlook’ (22).

## Philosophical responses to skepticism

We can see skepticism as the driving force in early modern philosophy. Descartes, Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, and Berkeley are all trying to answer the skeptic in different ways. Descartes believed that science had to be based on knowledge and certainty. Nothing less was good enough (23). (My note: at the same time, he rejected sense experience. Perhaps this is because of its role both in scholastic Aristotelianism and in contemporary, mitigated skepticism?)

### Descartes’s argument against skepticism

Descartes method of doubt works by taking skepticism further than even the skeptics themselves in order to find out if anything could survive the skeptical assault. Popkin traces the stages of the method in the *Discours* and *Meditations*.

1. Reject the senses because they can be deceptive and unreliable (*Discours* and *Meditations*).
1. Reject the external world because we may be dreaming (*Discours* and *Meditations*).
1. Reject mathematics because we may make mistakes even in the case of simple reasoning (*Discours* and *Meditations*).
1. Reject anything not yet rejected (?) and strengthen previous rejections because an evil demon may be affecting us (*Meditations* only).

Note that Popkin appears to take the argument of the demon to be that our beliefs may be wrong but not seen by us as wrong. That is, there’s a kind of illusion over our thinking. He doesn’t probe the question of whether the demon (or by analogy god) can make logical truths or simple mathematical truths otherwise. This is a deeper problem, I think (24).

The *cogito* is of course the stopping point of doubt. No matter what else may be false, *I think, therefore I am* cannot be false, according to Descartes. By examining this one truth, we find a criterion that allows us to discover further truths. According to Popkin, the criterion is clarity and distinctness (25).

Using this foundation, Descartes argues for a series of basic beliefs about causality and god. From here, Descartes argues for a benevolent god. This in turn allows him to get back sensation (in general), the external world (in terms of basic physics at least), and mathematics.

### Skeptical responses to Descartes

Critics immediately attacked Descartes, of course. Bourdin argued that the method of doubt was self-defeating. No one would ever emerge from it into the light of truth. Mersenne argued that god does deceive, at least if we take his revealed word, namely the bible, as witness. Mersenne also argued that truth for us and truth for god himself and the angels might be very different things. Gassendi argued against nearly everything Descartes said, but Descartes thought that the master objection was a kind of operationalism (my word). Descartes truths may be true for him but have no connection to the external world (26).

According to Popkin, the attacks of Mersenne and Gassendi prove that Descartes is a ‘sceptique malgré lui’ (27). Mersenne shows that clear and distinct truths can be doubted, in which case Descartes’s entire foundation collapses. Gassendi shows that we are forever locked into our own ideas. We cannot ever complete the activity of mapping the ideas we have onto external reality, the world as it is itself (27).

However, Popkin also thinks that Descartes’s attempt showed what philosophy would need to do in order to defeat skepticism (27-28).

+ It must point to indubitable truths.
+ It must describe an indubitable criterion of truth.
+ It must show how to gain objective rather than merely subjective truths.
