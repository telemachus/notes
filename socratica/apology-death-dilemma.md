The *Apology* presents a [constructive dilemma][cd] concerning death at
40c4-41c7.[^1]

[^1] People get very excited about the form of this argument, probably
because most dilemmas that you see in the wild are [destructive][dd]. So,
briefly and for fun, a constructive dilemma has the following form: If P,
then Q, if R then S, P or R. Therefore, Q or S. In the case of this
argument, both P and R lead to the same conclusion, namely that death is
good.
