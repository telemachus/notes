# Notes on *Getting Things Done*

## Chapter 1: A New Practice for a New Reality

+ Three key objectives: (1) capture everything you may need to to or that may be useful, (2) when you take things in, decide up-front what to do with them, and (3) review and coordinate everything you take in in a systematic way (4).
+ “Anything you consider unfinished in any way must be captured in a trusted system outside your mind, or what I call a collection tool, that you know you’ll come back to regularly and sort through” (14).
+ To get things done, you should (1) define what “done” means, what is the outcome? and (2) specify what “doing” looks like, what action(s) will you take? (21).
+ He recommends a bottom-up approach rather than a top-down one. Start with the basic actions rather than by trying to work out large-scale goals.
+ He recommends both a horizontal view (what are all the tasks out in front of us?) and a vertical view (what are all the steps needed for one task?) (22-23).

## Chapter 2: Getting Control of Your Life: The Five Steps of Mastering Workflow

1. *Capture* what has our attention.
1. *Clarify* what each item means and what to do about it.
1. *Organize* the results.
1. *Reflext* on options available to us.
1. *Engage* with what we need to to.

### Capture

Allen urges readers to capture “all the things you consider incomplete in your world—that is, anything personal or professional, big or little, of urgent or minor importance, that you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing” (30).

Capture tools include physical in-trays, pads and paper, digital and voice note-taking, email and texts, and scans of physical items.

#### Success Factors for Capturing

1. Put everything in a capture system.
1. Use as few capture buckets as possible.
1. Empty the buckets regularly.

### Clarify

Allen offers a flow chart (page 37), and I’ll describe that briefly here.

Initially, you should always ask “What is this?” In particular, Allen suggests the question, “Is this actionable?”

If no, then either throw it away, store it to consider later (tickler file), or store it for reference.

If yes, then consider the next action. If the next action would take less than two minutes, then simply do it. If no, then delegate or defer it. If you defer it for yourself, then 

If the input is a project, related to a project, or requires a project, then you put it on the projects list or into the project it’s a part of. You go over projects regularly as part of a weekly review.

#### Organize

Allen groups the results of capture and clarification into eight bins:

1. Trash (literal or digital)
1. Tickler file or storage
1. Reference file or storage
1. Project list
1. Project plans
1. Calendar
1. Reminders of next actions
1. Reminders of what you’re waiting to get back

#### Projects

Allen defines projects as “any desired result that can be accomplished within a year that requires more than one action step” (41). Some of these projects will be rather small, but that’s fine.

#### Next Actions

Put only three things on your calendar: time-specific actions, day-specific actions, and day-specific information. Don’t put to-do lists on your calendar. Time- and day-specific actions are clear. Day-specific information is anything you will want or need to know on a specific day even if it’s not an action.

Everything else that you want to do soon, but not on any specific date, should go in next action lists. You may need only one of these, but Allen thinks that most people will need more than one. If it’s just twenty or thirty, one list is fine. Otherwise, you should organize the items into categories and make separate lists.

## Chapter 3: Getting Projects Creatively Under Way

Allen believes that relatively informal planning is the best way to focus vertically and develop a plan in more depth. (Remember that “horizontal focus” is how Allen describes scanning the horizon of things that you have to do during collection and storage, which is the most important and primary step in his system. Vertical focus is a secondary, and less common, step.)

### The Natural Planning Model

Allen breaks this down into five steps, but he also insists that he is only describing what we all already do naturally.

1. Defining purpose and principles (why?)
1. Outcome visioning (what?)
1. Brainstorming (how?)
1. Organizing
1. Identifying next actions

### The Unnatural Planning Model

Although the natural model comes naturally to us, Allen acknowledges that we don’t use it as often as we should. Instead, we often use what he calls the “unnatural planning model.” In the unnatural model, someone starts from the question “Who has a good idea about this?” According to Allen, people start with this question too early. It’s a good question, but not if it comes before the purpose is define, the outcome is imagine, and brainstorming has happened.

## Chapter 4: Getting started: Setting Up the Time, Space, and Tools

Allen says that you need two full days, back to back in order to properly start the program. He wants you to have a work station at work, an identical or nearly identical one at home, and a mini-station in a bag if you travel a lot. The idea is that you should be ready to process things in the same way wherever you are.

Supplies he recommends:

+ Paper-holding trays
+ Plain paper
+ Pen or pencil
+ Post-its (3x3)
+ Stapler and staples
+ Scotch tape
+ Rubber bands
+ Automatic labeler
+ File folders
+ Calendar
+ Wastebasket and recycling bin
