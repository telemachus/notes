# Notes on the life of René Descartes

## Birth and basics

René Descartes was born on March 31, 1596 at La Haye. (The city of La Haye is approximately 50 kilometers south of Tours in the Central Loire Valley region of France. In 1802, the city was renamed La Haye-Descartes, and in 1967, it became simply Descartes.) His father, Joachim was a member of the Parlement of Brittany in Rennes; his mother Jeanne died in childbirth about a year after Descartes himself was born. As an infant, his maternal grandmother raised him. He attended the Collège Royal Henry-IV de La Flèche for seven or eight years, probably from 1606 or 1607 until 1614. He went on to study for two years at the University of Poitiers, where he earned a Baccalauréat and a law degree that qualified him to practice civil and canon law. However, he never practiced law.

## Background of his times

+ Descartes was born roughly 50 years after Copernicus published *De revolutionibus orbium celestium*, in which he argued for a heliocentric universe.
+ Descartes died roughly 40 years before Newton formulates the laws of mechanics and universal gravitation.
+ In 1610, a little less than 15 years after Descartes was born, Galileo detected the phases of Venus through a telescope.
+ In June of 1611 a poem was read in celebration of Galileo’s discovery of the moons of Jupiter was read at Descartes school, La Flèche. 
+ Galileo believed that mathematics was the key to understanding the world: ‘the grand book of the universe cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the alphabet in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics’ (*The Assayer*).
+ Kepler published his *Tables* on the movements of the planets in 1627.
+ Francis Bacon published the *Novum Organum* in 1620, a work that showed significant appreciation for systematic empirical research via induction.
+ Many of these men were deeply religious. There was not yet anything quite like the modern split between secular science and religious devotion.
+ In addition, if we call this a scientific revolution, we have to be sure that we remember that there was not yet any agreed upon scientific method. The advances of this generation created a world in which what we know as science came into existence.
+ In philosophical Latin of Descartes’ time, *scientia* means primarily ‘knowledge’. (In the plural it seems to mean what the French plural means: accredited branches of knowledge.)
+ The seventeenth-century term for what we call science is, more or less, *philosophia*. But Descartes also included in ‘philosophy’ what we think of as philosophy now: metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, and so on. So for Descartes, philosophy is both science and (our) philosophy.

## Scholasticism

Scholasticism is a system derived from a tradition of Aristotle interpretation. The system was developed in the 13th century and continued through the late medieval and renaissance periods. It represented a combination of the work of Aristotle and the doctrines of the Christian church. The scholastic approach revered authority—both the church’s and that of ancient texts, and it employed an enormous machinery of logic, fine distinctions, and complex terminology.

Descartes especially objected to two features of scholasticism:

1. The use of dialectic to win debating points rather than expand knowledge.
2. Aristotelian-style qualitative explanations, and a disregard for more quantitative methods. (See Molière’s joke about the ‘learned doctors’ who explain the power of opium to make us sleepy by referring to its ‘dormitive virtue’.) For Descartes a reference to such qualities is ‘really ust hte same as saying we perceive something in the objects whose nature we do not know’.

## Education

The school at La Flèche was relatively new when Descartes first attended, but it’s curriculum was very traditional. 

## Early travels

After finishing law school, Descartes left France and began to travel. He joined the Dutch States Army under the command of Maurice of Nassau. There he studied military engineering, and he met Isaac Beeckman, a Dutch philosopher and scientist. Beeckman helped inspire Descartes’ interests in philosophy, science, and math. Descartes dedicated his first book to Beeckman, a short *Compendium Musicae* that he wrote in 1618 but never published. Soon Descartes left Holland and enlisted with the forces of Maximilian of Bavaria. He visited Frankfurt in 1619 for the coronation of Ferdinand II. On his return to Bavaria in the winter, he stayed over near Ulm on the Danube. This is the famous *poêle*, or ‘stove-heated room’, that he describes in the *Discours*.
