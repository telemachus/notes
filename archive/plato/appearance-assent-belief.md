# Plato’s Appearance-Assent Account of Belief, Jessica Moss

(*Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*, Volume CXIV, Part 2, (2014), 213-238)

## I

Moss begins with the Hellenistic philosophers. Both Stoics and Sceptics think that there is a cognitive state similar to belief, but not as cognitively demanding (or arrogant, depending on your point of view). This state is φαντασία, appearance or impression, and it can involve “representation content” that is “similar” to that of belief (213). It can also “play a similar role to that (of) belief in causing behavior and emotion” (213). What are the differences between belief, properly speaking, and appearance?

* An appearance is relatively passive; a belief requires “active affirmation or assent” (214).
* A belief adds to appearance a judgment of truth.
* A belief assents to or asserts “something non-evident, something not contained with the appearance” (214). Moss explains this by reference to *PH* I 14 and I 27. A person who believes posits something as “really existing” or as “existing *in nature*” (214, her emphasis).

If we accept such a “representationally and functionally similar...sub-doxastic state”, namely “passive yielding to appearance” (214), then according to Moss we have (at least?) three ways to react to appearances.

1. A person can consider the appearance, fail to decide whether it is true, and suspend judgment. In this case, the person neither accepts nor rejects nor yields to the appearance. (Moss notes, however, that the person can still act as though the appearance were true.)
1. A person may affirm or deny the appearance actively. In these cases, the person has a belief properly speaking, whether positive or negative.
1. A person can “bypass this whole process” (of considering the appearance) and “simply let the appearance affect” them (214). This will leave disposed “to feel and act as if” the appearance were true (214). And we can follow Sextus and call this “assent” in a broader sense, but there is no belief properly speaking.

Moss stresses that appearance is *not* merely entertaining a proposition. By yielding, the person lets the appearance in, so to speak. As Moss says, they do not merely hold “it at arm’s length” (215). She further argues that one can only keep an appearance at a distance in that way “once the question of its truth has arisen” (215). She thus agrees that “strictly speaking” appearances are “non-epistemic” or “non-doxastic”, but she also insists that these terms are misleading insofar as they “imply something like suspension of judgement” (215). The key point for Moss is that yielding “is instead a matter of not letting the question of the appearance’s truth arise” (215). The question can fail to arise in different ways: children and animals simply aren’t capable of asking such questions of appearances; sceptics apparently choose to act as if they were incapable of asking such questions.

Moss wants to look at Platonic antecedents to this set of ideas. However, she admits that it can be hard to see these ideas in Plato for two reasons. First, Plato’s terminology is very different from that of his Hellenistic descendants. Instead of contrasting δόξα with φαντασία, Plato contrasts δόξα with εἰκασία (appearance) in the *Republic* and with αἴσθησις (perception) in the *Theaetetus*. Second, Plato distinguishes cognitive states by their objects more than by their “psychological history” (216). However, Moss wants to claim that psychological differences follow the ontological distinctions and that Plato has a distinction very like the Hellenistic one between passive assent to an appearance and active affirmation of reality. Finally, Moss notes that although she translates δόξα as belief, this may come to seem like a mistake. Her own account of Plato’s view of δόξα may suggest a far more demanding and narrow definition than “belief”.
