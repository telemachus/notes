# Stoics on emotions

The Stoics say the sage lacks all emotions. Critics have a problem with this for
all the obvious reasons. Supporters defend the Stoics with the following
argument, give or take.

> The Stoic position does not require the sage to be a robot or beyond-Spock
> creature of logic alone. Stoics only go without *what they call* emotions, but
> they only apply the word *emotion* to a specific negative range of feelings.
> These emotions have two flaws: (i) they are too strong and make us wild and
> uncontrolled and (ii) they depend on false beliefs. On the other hand, Stoics
> believe that the sage experiences joy, fear, and desire. However, the Stoic
> version of these emotions does not suffer from either of the two flaws listed
> above. Thus, the Stoic sage still has feelings that *we might call* emotions.
> And, thus, the Stoic sage is not a robot or creature of pure logic.

I have many questions. Here are the most important.

1. Are both flaws involved in every case of a negative emotion?
1. Do all emotions have indifferents as their objects? Or do some emotions have
   genuine good and evil, i.e., virtue and vice, as their objects?
1. Why is there no good grief? In the case of pleasure, desire, and fear, there
   are good alternatives. These are the so-called *eupatheiai* (namely joy,
   hope, and caution, respectively). Why is there no good version of grief?
1. Do *eupatheiai* have only good and evil as their objects? Or do some
   *eupatheiai* have indifferents as their objects.
