# Descartes and the project of pure enquiry, Bernard Williams

> This is a book about Descartes’s philosophy, and it is as a philosopher that Descartes is now principally known; but by his own conception of things that is an irony. The project we shall be studying is a philosophical project, but it was intended by Descartes to be preliminary to a larger enterprise of science, medicine and technology, which would confer practical benefits on mankind. It was a product of his historical situation that he could hope for his project to have these results. It was also a feature of his situation that he could conceive of that project (as we shall see) as conducted by a solitary thinking, as transparent to human reason, and as definitively revealing how knowledge is, after all, possible. (30-31)

## Chapter 2: The Project

Descartes undertakes the same task as any enquirer: “trying to find the truth” (34). However, he does it in a way unlike other enquirers, namely “from the very beginning”. He believes that his method of doubt is (i) the right method for this job and (ii) *obviously* the right method for the job. His basic aim is to discover the truth (35).
