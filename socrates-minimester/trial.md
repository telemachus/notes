# Notes on the trial

## Debra Nails

### Procedural outline

* A prosecutor first issued a formal summons, in speech or in writing (?). This summons (i) stated the charge and (ii) required the defendant to appear on a set day before a relevant magistrate. (The magistrate would vary by crime.)
* In the case of the trial of Socrates, the relevant magistrate was the king-archon (ἄρχων βασιλεύς), who presided over homicide cases and cases of impiety. (What else did the king-archon preside over?)
* The prosecutor had to give at least four days between the notification and the appearance before the magistrate. In addition, the prosecutor had to deliver the summons to the defendant personally, in front of witnesses. (If you couldn’t find the defendant, it was apparently allowed to just read out the summons in front of the person’s house, but this was apparently unusual or a later practice.) The prosecutor did not have to notify the judge of the day just the defendant.
* The defendant was not obligated to appear with the prosecutor before the king-archon. However, if the defendant did not appear, the case was guaranteed to go forward.
* A citizen could almost always go into voluntary exile legally. (Nails mentions only parricide as an exception.)
* If the defendant appears before the king-archon, they enter a plea at the preliminary hearing. (TODO: What else happens during the preliminary hearing?)

### Historical background

* Nails claims that there “in 399 [there] was a wave of religious fundamentalism that brought with it a steep rise in the number of impiety cases in Athenian courts” (5).

### Athenian Legal Procedures

* Citizens prosecute other citizens. There is no state prosecutor. Prosecutors can act alone, or they can get fellow prosecutors. Meletus led the prosecution against Socrates, and Anytus and Lycon were fellow prosecutors.
* The prosecutor produces a formal writ. These writs were called either a *dikē* (δίκη), if the charges alleged private wrong-doing, or a *graphē* (γραφή), if the charges alleged public wrong-doing. Meletus wrote out a *graphē* against Socrates, and such a writ included the charges and, if there was not a set penalty, also a penalty. The defendent had the right to fight the charge by producing a writ as well. They would then argue before an official, and the official would decide whether the case went forward. If the defendent did not challenge the case, the prosecution went forward by default.
* Meletus made two charges against Socrates: (1) he does not recognize the gods of Athens and introduces new gods and (2) he corrupts young men.
* Socrates contested his case, as Plato 18c7 shows, and as *Euthyphro* makes clear.
* Xenophon 2.9-9.15 happens around the time of the preliminary hearing but before the main hearing started. Xenophon 10.16-26.12 and all of Plato’s *Apology* represent the hearing.
* Prosecutors and defenders speak themselves. Athens does not have professional legal representatives who do this for people. However, there were λογογράφοι or λογοποιοί, who wrote speeches for people. If you use a speechwriter, you still deliver the speech yourself and you cannot say that someone else wrote your words. People did it, but the rules said you should not.
* The whole trial happened within a single day. Each side had equal time, and they were timed by a water clock. If one side had three speakers, they split their total time however they wanted. One side could yield time to the other if they wanted to look confident! (Less serious crimes were tried as many as four in one day.)
* A panel of 500 jurors (or more sometimes?) heard the case and voted on guilt and penalty. Although a magistrate was present, the magistrate didn’t really run the trial like a judge. He didn’t instruct the jury on matters of law, and he didn’t keep order in the room or control the speakers in any way. Jurors swore an oath to listen to both sides and to vote in accordance with the laws.
* The prosecution spoke first, and then the defense replied. Each spoke only one: they give their whole case, including any evidence or witness testimony, as a single speech.
* Denyer hypothesizes that the prosecution did not name any specific young person that Socrates harmed. He thinks that amnesty of 404 prevented anyone from mentioning Critias or Alcibiades (11).
* Speakers did not question or cross-question witnesses. In general, the role of a witness was minimal, and a clerk read their testimony during later trials. (The change happens soon after the trial of Socrates, but it is unrelated to his trial.)
* Prosecutors and defenders could question each other. We see Socrates do this in Plato’s (24c7-28a5) and Xenophon’s (19.35-21.15) *Apology*.
* The jury did not deliberate. They voted as soon as the defense finished its speech. The votes were secret. In the case of a tie, the defendant won; otherwise, whoever had more votes won. In a *graphē*, if the prosecutor did not get at least 1/5 of the votes, he was liable to a fine of 1000 drachmas. This was a great deal of money: approximately a year-and-a-half’s pay for a skilled worker. Socrates was convinced by 280 to 220 votes.
* The prosecutor spoke briefly in support of his proposed punishment. The defendant spoke for an equal amount of time with an alternative punishment. The jurors voted for one or the other; they had no third option.
* Normally both prosecutor and defendant had incentives to aim for a medium-sized penalty, but the trial of Socrates was unusual. Socrates proposed either nothing, free meals for life, or a small fine. (Denyer goes through five versions of this, but they are all basically the same except in detail.)
* Both Plato and Xenophon say that Socrates spoke after the penalty phase. It isn’t clear to me that this was normal though. According to Denyer, this case is our only evidence for this practice.
* In theory, convicted people received their penalty immediately. However, Socrates stayed in jail 30 days before he was put to death. The Delian festival started at the same time as his trial, and during that festival nobody could be executed.
