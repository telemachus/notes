# “The Second Meditation and the Essence of the Mind”, John P. Carriero, in *Essays on Descartes’ Meditations*, ed. Amélie Oskenberg Rorty.

## Context counts

According to C(arriero) many recent interpretations of the second meditation go wrong because they fail to take its background seriously enough. In particular, these readers interpret the second meditation in such a way that it becomes “not a sustained argument but a series of reminders” and they fail to understand the important connections between the *cogito* argument and the discussion of ‘this wax’ (199).

## Background

### Aquinas

> In the Second Meditation Descartes tries to do exactly what Aquinas thought could not be done: he tries not only to prove his existence but also to understand the *nature* of the human mind without assuming that body exists. It is this enterprise that links the *cogito* with the rest of the Second Meditation and, in particular, with his consideration of the nature of a piece of wax, thus forming a single, sustained argument (200).

Aquinas, following Aristotle, believes that the senses and the intellect are both necessary for understanding. Even to understand a universal, we must start with sensory experience. If Socrates sees a dog, his sensitive soul takes on the form of an individual, material dog. When the intellect abstracts away from specific dogs and forms an understanding of doghood, it becomes like the form of a universal, immaterial dog. Notice, however, that Aquinas relies on the principle *nihil est in intellectu, nisi prius fuerit in sensu* (200).

Aquinas believes that the soul knows itself in two ways. (i) The soul knows *that* it exists. (ii) The soul knows *what* it is. In the first case, “the mere presence of the mind suffices”, and this type of knowledge “explains why no one can deny that he exists” (200). In the second case, it requires “a careful and subtle inquiry” in order for the intellect to reach knowledge of *what* it is. This second type of knowledge is far more important than the first, and it cannot occur, as we will see, without sensory input.

A sidenote: Aquinas provides a brief version of what sounds very like Descartes’ *cogito* argument.

> In the other way, [to think that something does not exist] is taken to mean that assent is given to what is thus conceived. In this sense, no one can assent to the thought that he does not exist. For, in thinking something, he perceives that he exists. (*De Verit.*, Q 10, A. 12, ad 7, quoted in Carriero, 202)

#### Methodology

> According to Aristotle, the faculties or powers of the soul are understood through their acts or operations and an act or operation is understood through its object (202).
