# Outline

## Introduction: the problem and why it matters

Socrates says bizarre things and the part about non-survival in particular doesn't suit him at all.

It matters because this is a quasi-mythical peroration, in the manner of *Gorgias*, *Phaedo*, *Republic*.

## Previous solutions and why they don't work

There are two basic solutions. (1) It's deliberately bad because it's supposed to make us think. (2) It's not really an argument at all, just some ἐλπίς.

## My solution

The dilemma is real and exhaustive, but the arguments in the two horns are tailored in an *ad hominem* manner to the people who would accept that horn.

## Conclusion

Sum up, plus the Socratic thing where I acknowledge that my solution may not be perfect, ubt I strongly affirm the problem at the very least.
