# *These Truths: A History of the United States* Jill Lepore

## Introduction

Lepore argues that the Constitution “was meant to mark the start of a new era, in which the course of history might be made predictable and a government established that would be ruled not by accident and force but by reason and choice” (xi). She gets that contrast from Alexander Hamilton, who wrote in the first *Federalist* paper that Americans would “decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection or choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force” (xiii-xiv).

Lepore claims that “the American experiment rests on three political ideals,” or what Jefferson called “these truths” (xiv). Lepore describes these as “political equality, natural rights, and the sovereignty of the people” (xiv). In addition to these moral ideals, Lepore believes that the United States relies on “a dedication to inquiry” and the study of history (xv). In these ways, the animating spirit of the US has more in common with science and interpretative fields than with faith or religion. “[Early Americans] believed that truth is to be found in ideas about morality but also in the study of history” (xv).

Lepore notes that several crucial early-American concepts come from the legal system: facts, knowledge, evidence, proof. She claims that these concepts moved into the sciences in the seventeenth century and into history and politics in the eighteenth century.
