# *Racism: A Short History* by George M. Fredrickson

## Chapter One: Religion and the Invention of Racism

Fredrickson argues that we find the seeds of modern racism in a religious
context in late medieval Europe.  Christianity always had a difficult
relationship with Jews who did not convert, but things grew worse in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  Some Christians demonized Jews; they
claimed that Jews killed Christian children for their rituals or abused
consecrated hosts.  Christians also began to strongly associate Jews with the
devil, to consider them subhuman.  Some people also blamed the Black Death
(1346 to 1353) on Jews, who supposedly poisoned wells to create the plague.
In addition, as explorers became familiar with people further and further from
Europe, some Europeans assumed or developed attitudes of superiority to the
indigenous peoples that they encountered.  These negative attitudes towards
Jews and non-Europeans sometimes took on what Fredrickson considers
a distinctive and essential component: the notion that the differences were
hereditary and unchangeable.

However, Fredrickson also argues that Christianity prevented a truly
systematic, universalizing form of racism.  Officially, the Catholic church
and other religious groups still maintained the universal message of the
gospel.  According to this vision, all humans were essentially the same (made
by god, in his image, etc.), and all people could be and should be converted.
Whoever converted deserved all the rights of any other Christian.  Of course,
this ideal vision was not always honored.  At times we see clear ideas of
“purity of blood” as necessary for full rights.  In addition, some people
denied that Jews or some non-Europeans could truly convert to Christianity.
Nevertheless, Fredrickson maintains that medieval Christianity prevented the
full flowering of racism as he understands it.  That would come later, though
as he acknowledges, we see its beginnings in medieval Europe.
