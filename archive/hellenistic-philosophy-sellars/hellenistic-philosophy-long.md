# *Hellenistic Philosophy: Stoics, Epicureans, Sceptics*, A.A. Long (Duckworth, London, 1986)

## Stoicism

### (i) Theory of Knowledge

Long begins his account with *impressions* (φαντασίαι). He argues that for the Stoics give a developmental account of content. People are born with minds “like a blank sheet of paper” (123). They are capable of receiving input, and sense perception (also φαντασία) produces the first input. Concepts arise from repeated perceptions “of the same thing or type of thing” (124) in combination with innate mental abilities to see resemblance and analogy and abilities to combine, transpose, and oppose perceptions. (So far, this should sound much like Arisotle and early British empiricists.)

More mature humans use language to understand and express their perceptions and thoughts. For the Stoics, thought is articulate just as language itself is. Long describes this part of Stoicism as having a “very modern ring” (124).
