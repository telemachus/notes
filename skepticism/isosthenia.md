# ἰσοσθένεια in Hellenistic philosophy

## Epicurus

The term ἰσοσθένεια appears when Diogenes Laertius addresses Epicurus’s views in epistemology. First, Diogenes states the criteria of truth for Epicurus: perceptions, prolepses, and feelings (X 31 αἰσθήσεις, προλήψεις, πάθη). Diogenes then appears to quote Epicurus who explains that “every perception is without reason and memory”. By way of explanation of this (γάρ), Epicurus explains that perception doesn’t change itself nor can it add or remove anything as a result of external influence of any kind. I take the point to be that sensation is a reliable witness, in these ways: it doesn’t add or remove information itself, and nothing else can cause it to do so. Epicurus then argues that nothing exists which is capable of refuting sensations. In support of this claim, Epicurus invokes ἰσοσθένεια. Unfortunately, the argument in which the term appears is complex and a bit confused, and Epicurus does not elaborate on the force of ἰσοσθένεια at all. However, we can start to get a sense of its importance from the larger argument.

Epicurus offers a series of arguments in defense of his claim that nothing exists which can refute the senses: οὐδὲ ἔστι τὸ δυνάμενον αὐτὰς (sc. αἰσθήσεις) διελέγξαι (X 31). (These arguments, especially the first three sound strikingly like Pyrrhonian arguments in Sextus Empiricus.)

1. Α perception of one kind cannot refute one of the same kind on account of ἰσοσθένεια.
1. A perception of one kind cannot refute one of another kind because they are not judges of the same things.
1. Reason cannot refute sensations for all reason depends on sensation.
1. One perception cannot refute another for we attend to them all.
1. The existence of sensory recognitions (ἐπαισθήματα) proves the truth (reality?) of perceptions. And that we see and hear is as real as that we feel pain. (I’m not entirely sure if this last argument is connected to what precedes or if it’s the beginning of a new section.)
