In his preface, Warne writes that he had a hard time finding secondary
literature on Plato that met his "needs as a second-year undergraduate"
(xi). In one sense, this is surely surprising since introductory works on
Plato have always been popular. But Warne goes on to make clear that he
wasn't looking for just any introductory book: "Frequently, arguments
appeared to ahve been plucked from dialogues and appraised with reference
to remarks in other dialogues, which left little sense of [the] whole from
which they were taken"[[1]] (xi). This makes clear that Warne didn't want
just any introduction to Plato and that the introduction he has written has
a specific aim. Although I have concerns about a number of Warne's choices,
overall this book does admirably succeed in its purpose of providing
stimulating introductions to the arguments of individual dialogues with
little or no reference to other works by Plato (much less other ancient
authors).
