# ‘The Rediscovery of Ancient Skepticism in Modern Times’, C. B. Schmitt

(in *The Skeptical Tradition*, ed. Myles Burnyeat, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, 225-251)

## Introduction

Although ‘some attention’ has been given to explaining the ‘recovery of ancient skeptical doctrine by Renaissance thinkers, we still lack a comprehensive survey  of the process whereby ancient skeptical ideas were assimilated into the early modern consciousness’ (224).

## History and texts

S places the start of skepticism as a philosophy with Pyrrho (circa 360-270 BCE). He considers Sextus Empiricus (circa 160-210 CE) as a terminal point, and thus considers about a 500 year active range for skepticism in antiquity. No primary texts survive from early skepticism. We have Sextus, who is a later follower—S calls his works ‘compendia’ (226), Cicero, who wrote works of ‘skeptical inspiration’ (226), and Diogenes Laertius, who gives us testimony but is not himself a skeptic. Among pagan and early Christian authors who give information on ancient skepticism, S mentions Plutarch, Galen, Ptolemy, Aulus Gellius, Lactantius, Jerome, and Eusebius.

The Academic school did not survive into the Middle Ages. It is still one of the big three for Cicero, and Augustine (354-430 CE) seems to be the latest author to treat the Academics ‘as a living force’ (226). Of the three major sources of skepticism, the works of Sextus and Cicero’s Academics were almost completely unknown in the Middle Ages, and Diogenes’s *Life of Pyrrho* seems to have been absolutely unknown, though there is a work from the Middle Ages based on Diogenes’s *Lives* (227). (Wouldn’t it be easier to assume that Pyrrho’s life was there, but simply not of interest in the Middle Ages?)

As well known as Cicero was, there was very little discussion of his *Academica* in the Middle Ages. A few authors mention it, and one—Henry of Ghent—appears to know at least part of it directly. But for the most part, Academic skepticism is known only through Augustine’s *Contra Academicos*, if even that.

Anti-intellectual or skeptical thought appears in the Middle Ages from two sources. First, there was a strain of Christian mysticism that downplayed knowledge and intellect (228). And, second, some genuine skeptical thought that comes to Europe from Arabic and Hebrew authors (228). All of this seems relatively minor though.

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the works of Sextus, Diogenus Laertius, and Cicero reappear. S argues that in the case of skepticism rebirth as a result of renewed knowledge of ancient authors is more important than any native continuity through the Middle Ages (228-229). (This is a battle between historians of Europe that I have no larger stake in or knowledge of.) S also notes that he is concerned with philosophical skepticism, skepticism about knowledge, not with religious skepticism. Although skepticism in general began to have an ‘antireligious tinge’ in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, this was not the case in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when Fideism was popular (229).

## Tracing the big three

### Cicero

There is an increase in interest in Cicero’s *Academica* in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but it doesn’t really take hold seriously until the sixteenth. Although several earlier figures mention it, they don’t seem to know it especially well or to rely on it very deeply. S’s argument is that early Renaissance authors did not know what to do with the *Academica*. They admired Cicero for rhetoric and philosophy, but they didn’t know enough about Academic skepticism to appreciate or understand his attacks on Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics.

In the mid-1500s, some French authors began to use the *Academics* as a stick to beat the standard Aristotelian curriculum in schools. They wanted to replace the scholastic curriculum, and Cicero gave them ammunition in their fight against Aristotle (231). This was followed by an attack on Cicero’s positions from Italy a few years later, as Giulio Castellani attempts a ‘point-by-point rebuttal of Cicero’s skeptical argument *more peripatetico*’ (231).

As a sidenote, both Talon and Castellani mention a reference in Cicero to the earth’s movement. Cicero refers to Hicetas of Syracuse (*Academica* II.123) for the view that the earth moves while other heavenly bodies are at rest. Copernicus himself knew about Hicetas, probably from Cicero, and this the *Academica* had a small role in a very large contemporary debate.

### Diogenes Laertius

Ambrogio Traversari translated Diogenes Laertius’s *Lives* into Latin in the 1430s, and after that, Diogenes’s work was ‘widely known’ (233). In addition, Traversari’s translation is likely to be responsible for the ‘introduction of the word *scepticus* into the Latin vocabulary’ (233). Aulus Gellius had used the word, but it was generally written in Greek, even in that case. Although the word was in Latin translations of Sextus, it didn’t take off from there. By the start of the sixteenth century the word was ‘fairly common’ and by the end of the centruy it was everywhere, ‘firmly established in everyone’s vocabulary’.

### Sextus Empiricus

The works of Sextus are the key to the development of later skepticism in Europe. They were virtually unknown in the West during the Middle Ages, unknown to both Arabs and Jews, but familiar to Greek authors in the Byzantine Empire. There was an (early?) partial translation of Sextus into Latin, but it seems to have had little influence. (S devotes a small digression to showing how (i) Sextus was better known in Byzantium and (ii) that skepticism played a larger role in Christian thought in the East than in the West.)

In 1427, Francesco Filelfo brought back Greek manuscripts of Sextus from Constantinople. Before too long, the Greek text was widely known, and copies of the text were (relatively) available. Savanarola wanted to have a complete translation done, but it’s not clear that this happened. Nevertheless, by the end of the fifteenth century, there was widespread interest in the works of Sextus in Rome, Venice, and Florence.

In 1520, Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola, nephew of the better-known Mirandola, wrote a book using Sextus to attack Aristotle’s sense-based epistemology. S argues that this is the first true phiosophical use of Sextus and skepticism in the west for hundreds of years.

Then in 1562, Stephanus’s Latin translation of the *Outlines of Pyrrhonism* appeared. in 1569, Gentian Hervet’s translation of *Adversus mathematicos* appeared as well. Skepticism takes off afer this, even though the *editio princeps* of Sextus did not appear until 1621, which as S points out, is ‘nearly 200 years after’ the first Greek manuscripts reached Italy. But even before that, the translation allowed for significant engagement with Pyrrhonian skepticism from thinkers like Sanches, Montaigne, and Charron.

Before 1520, there was much greater knowledge and interest in skepticism in Italy than in the north of Europe, but between 1520 and 1550, something changed drastically. Italian interest waned, while it grew and grew north of the Alps.

## Conclusions

1. Skepticism came to Europe through Sextus, not through Aristotelian writers.
1. Skeptical ideas traveled from Italy to northern Europe during the sixteenth century. This is similar to most other ancient ideas in the Renaissance. The texts reach Italy in the fifteenth century, and from there they move into Europe.
1. Even before Sextus’s works were available in printed editions, skeptical ideas were becoming well known via translation and via Cicero. Skepticism itself began to flourish in the last third of the sixteenth century, although it was still less important than other recently rediscovered ancient philosophies. Moreover, the continuous tradition of Aristotelianism remained far stronger for some time.
1. With Hume, in the eighteenth century, skepticism first becomes linked with antireligious sentiment and argument.
1. The medieval tradition of criticism and logical analysis remained largely distinct from skepticism until modern scholarship.
