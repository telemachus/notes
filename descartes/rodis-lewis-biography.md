# Descartes: His Life and Thought, Geneviève Rodis-Lewis

## Prologue

RL starts with the celebrations for the *Discours* in 1937 and 1987. She notes that the *Discours* is meant for everyone, and she reminds us that Descartes chose French for this reason. She stresses that the autobiographical elements are used to help readers draw lessons for themselves rather than to teach readers about the life of Descartes.

> A biography of the philosopher should illuminate certain points that are properly historical and often poorly known, but it should also make every effort to approach his exceptional personality (viii).

RL recommends that we follows the advice Descartes gives readers in his *Principles of Philosophy*. First skim the book like a novel; then go back and rework particular parts if you have curiosity to do so (viii).

RL mentions several key areas of controversy for a life of Descartes. First, the status of his family and Descartes’ resistance to the law. Second, the dates when Descartes studied at La Flèche, how long he was at Poitiers---and what he studied there. The character of Descartes’ youth and the sincerity, depth, and nature of his religious belief.

## Descartes’s Biographers

+ Two short works in Latin soon after Descartes’ death: (i) Daniel Lipstorp and (ii) Pierre Borel. Lispstorp knew that Descartes was born at La Haye; Borel initially thought at Châtellerault, but he corrected himself in his second edition. Lipstorp exaggerates the nobility of the family; Borel places Descartes at all the major sieges of his time in the army. But they have some value.
+ Our principal source is Adrien Baillet. He published a number of texts that have since disappeared, though he often paraphrases them. Some doubt Baillet’s views on Descartes’ celibacy and piety because Baillet wrote lives of saints. RL criticizes Baillet (i) for mistakes about the dates at La Flèche, (ii) mistakes about what Descartes studied at Poitiers, (iii) wrongly believing that Descartes joined the military because his father wished it, as well as several other smaller matters.
+ Adam, in the Adam and Tannery edition, follows Baillet too naively.
+ The correct dates for Descartes schooling at La Flèche were 1607-1615. J. Sirven established this in 1928, and Gilson followed correctly.
+ Descartes said ‘Larvatus prodeo’: ‘I go forward wearing a mask’. Is this a reference to atheism? Was he a secret libertine?
+ RL says that modern works that question the Baillet view of Descartes as a secular saint matter: ‘Above all, they call for a new reflection on that man who wished to join the military to travel throughout Europe, before isolating himself in a solitude so complete that it is impossible to situate’ (xvi).
+ RL notes the joking nickname ‘D’Escartes’ before ending with the observation that in the winter of 1619-1620, he decided to devote his life to advancing in knowledge of truth and at the end of his life ‘advancing in the search for truth’ remained ‘the principal good in this life’ for Descartes (xvi-xvii).

## Family and Childhood

René Descartes was born in La Haye, Touraine, on March 31, 1596. His father was Joachim Descartes, probably the son of Pierre Descartes, a doctor from Châtellerault in Poitou. The grandfather was not a member of the nobility, which was rare for doctors. However, a road to the nobility was the practice of law, especially if this practice continued for three generations. Joachim pursued this road, working first in Paris and then as a counselor at the Parliament of Brittany. He wanted his sons and grandsons to be lawyers as well in order to enoble the family. His family received a first degree of nobility only in 1668. Descartes mother was Jeanne, née Brochard, and the home of his mother’s family was also in Châtellerault.

Descartes had an older brother, Pierre, and and older sister, Jeanne. Pierre left for La Flèche in 1604 when the school opened. Jeanne remained at their grandmother’s house until the grandmother died in 1610. Their mother died in May of 1597 after giving birth to a son who died three days later. However, Descartes seems not to have known these facts. In a letter to Princess Elizabeth, Descartes wrote that his mother died after complications from *his* birth.

As a child Descartes was sickly. He might have started at La Flèche in 1604 as well, but they waited until 1607 to send him. After the death of their mother, Joachim remarried, set up a house in Rennes and had another son and daughter. Jeanne moved there after the death of their grandmother in 1610. René got along well with the sister and her husband, remaining friendly with his brother-in-law even after the death of his sister. However, he did not get along well with his brother Pierre.

## Studies

According to RL, Descartes attended the College at La Flèche from Easter of 1607 to September of 1615. He thus started doubly late: he was old enough to begin in 1604, when the school opened; and he did not begin at the start of a year. She attributes the late starts to health. She also notes that the precise dates have long been in dispute. (She hints that the illness that bothered Descartes for so long---the ‘dry cough’ that he lost only after he was 20 (10)---was tuberculosis (10).

The school at La Flèche was free except for boarding costs. There were 1200-1400 students representing ‘every background; there were even sons of tradespeople and peasants’. Descartes appreciated the diversity of student backgrounds, and he also praised the Jesuits for treating all the students with near complete equality (11). One special treatment for Descartes was that he was allowed to stay in past the normal early time of five o’clock. Normal bedtime was at nine, so boys were meant to get eight hours sleep. But Descartes was allowed to stay in his room and join classes at ten o’clock (12).

Descartes received significant training in Latin, eight or nine years worth. Students spend three years learning ‘grammar’ (i.e., basic syntax, morphology, and vocabulary?). This was followed by one year in humanities, one in rhetoric, and three in philosophy. In his ninth year, Descartes may have started the university course in Latin, or he may have done an extra year of grammar (12-13). Although he also studied Greek, he apparently took little interest in it and soon forgot whatever he learned. However, accoring to RL, Descartes developed and maintained a lifelong love of poetry in general and Latin poets in particular (12-14).

In 1611 a student wrote a poem in French celebrating Galileo’s 1610 discovery of the moons of Jupiter (his findings were published in 1611). RL speculates that Descartes may have written the poem. However, this appears to be pure speculation. We have no specific evidence of any kind about the author of the poem, and it was not a small school. What are the odds that the student most famous to us now wrote the poem?

If we take the *Discours* as evidence, then Descartes enjoyed math above all, even though he had some complaints about how it was taught. He believed that the foundations of math were solid, but he was frustrated that the focus was so practical (engineering and mechanics). Physics he found very weak, relying as it did on Aristotelian formal explanations. He also thought little of how he was taught ethics since it all flowed from merely probable chains of reasoning. The ethics portion of the course seems to have been based more on the Stoics than Aristotle. Descartes has little admiration for the unrealistic grandeur of the Stoic sage and the sage’s insensitivity to emotion. Descartes scorns the suicide of Cato and the assassination of Caesar by Brutus as examples of what Stoicism produces. RL notes that the provisional ethics of the *Discours* bears heavy traces of Stoic influence, but she argues that by the time of *The Passions of the Soul* Descartes has move ‘very far’ from ‘what he was taught at school’ (16).

RL notes that Descartes mentions theology in the *Discours* even though it isn’t clear that he would have studied it at La Flèche. She speculates that he may have sat in on a few classes with the novices, that he overheard other students, or perhaps he simply looked at a book. But I wonder if it doesn’t undermine her implicit belief that the *Discours* is so strongly autobiographical rather than idealized and general.

RL connects the scholastic method of contrary argument with Descartes dislike of mere probability and his early (pre-hyperbolic) doubt. In this early doubt, Descartes (i) suspects that nearly all opinions in the contrary method are false (because the truth would impose itself on both parties if it were available) and (ii) holds as ‘virtually false everything that was merely probable’. She also connects this early scepticism with Descartes’ desire to travel and to learn from the ‘book of the world’.

Picking up on travel and the world, RL speculates briefly about whether or not Descartes read Montaigne as a young man. She makes no firm decision either way, but she does point out that unlike Montaigne or his followers Descartes firmly rejected the merely probable in favor of a relentless pursuit of absolute certainty.

Descartes never needed the money from a career. As RL notes, Descartes did receive a license for law (in 1616), just as his older brother did in 1613. However, he never practiced. And in the *Discours* he specifies that he does not need to be a doctor or a lawyer to earn money or nobility, and that he is glad for this freedom.

RL takes the line that when he describes his years at school, ‘Descartes makes every effort to translate as best he can into his adult language what he felt at the time’ (19). I’m not so sure. In particular I think that she plays down the persuasive goals of the autobiography in the *Discours*.

After his time at La Flèche, Descartes went to Poitiers to receive his law licence. This was apparently to please his father. Afterwards however, he gave up the idea of law and joined the army as a volunteer. RL argues that he joined the army on his own initiative and that Descartes’ father would have disliked the idea because without nobility, there was no real career in the army.

After acquiring his law degree, Descartes returned home until in March of 1618 he turned twenty-one. After that age, he was free to do as he wanted. Sometime around then, he left for Breda, in the Netherlands, to join the army.
