Why compare Crispin Sartwell and Plato on knowledge? In a nutshell, they offer sharply opposed definitions of knowledge and they shed light on each other. Sartwell argues that knowledge is merely true belief.\footcite{sartwell1991, sartwell1992} Plato stands at the start of a tradition that insists that knowledge is not merely true belief. If Sartwell is right, then Plato is partly responsible for creating a blindspot that makes it difficult even to consider the proper definition of knowledge. On the other hand, Plato may do something that Sartwell argues few (no?) contemporary philosophers do: give \textit{reasons} to believe that true belief alone is insufficient to be knowledge.
