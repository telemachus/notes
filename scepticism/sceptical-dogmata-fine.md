# Sceptical *dogmata*: *Outlines of Pyrrhonism* I 13
(Gail Fine: *Méthexis* volume 13, 2000, 81-105)

## I: Introduction

Fine begins from the especially “vexed” question “whether ancient sceptics disavow all, or only some, beliefs” (81). She proposes to consider the no belief and the some belief view, and she specifies that she is only here concerned with what the sceptics claim about their beliefs. That is, she acknowledges that it may be difficult to understand what it means to hold, literally, no beliefs, but for the moment, she only cares about what the sceptics say—whether or not what they claim is genuinely possible.

Fine begins by distinguishing two questions:
1. Do sceptics disavow all, or only some δόγματα?[^1]
1. Do they disavow all, or only some, beliefs, as we understand belief?
Fine describes (1) as an internal question and (2) as an external question. (1) is a matter of what the sceptics say “in their own words” (81) while (2) is a matter of whether the sceptics have belief by our lights.

According to Fine the internal question is easy to answer, but the external one is hard in more than one way. (1) is easy to settle since in I 13, Sextus “explicitly says that sceptics have δόγματα. However, we are still left with (2), which remains a very difficult problem. First, it can be difficult to map what Sextus says onto modern views about belief. Second, there is no *one* “agreed concept of belief that ‘we’ all share: belief is understood in various ways” (81). Fine proposes first to explain what she will mean by belief and then to determine whether Sextus says that sceptics have beliefs if “belief” is understood as Fine understands it. She severely limits the scope of her study: she considers only Sextus, and in fact only a very small portion of *PH* Book I.[^2]

## II: Belief

Fine begins this section by noting that very little has been written about belief, especially compared to knowledge. That is, everyone agrees that knowledge is a difficult and complex concept, but philosophers tend to take belief “for granted”. However, it is not obvious that belief is so simple nor that people agree on what belief is. Fine tells us that she will discuss the (different) views of belief in Burnyeat and Frede, and then she will lay out her view of belief.

Burnyeat and Frede disagree over the connection between belief and truth. Burnyeat thinks that “if A believes p, A takes p to be true” (82). As Fine writes, this is “hardly idiosyncratic” (82). In fact, many people think that this connection between truth and belief is true by definition.[^3] However, not everyone agrees. Frede, for example rejects what Fine calls “the standard view” (83). Frede argues that there is a difference between (i) having a view and (ii) making a claim or taking a position. Both are cases of belief, but only the second involves taking as true.

Fine considers several possible interpretations of Frede’s view over several pages, and in the end, she rejects his claim. According to Fine, Frede never establishes a sense of belief that is (i) limited and specific enough to be useful[^4] and also (ii) doesn’t involve taking as true. In order to continue with the main line of thought, I’m going to put my notes on this section in an appendix at the end rather than here.

At the end of this section, Fine gives her own view of belief and she makes clear where she stands vis-à-vis the rival interpretations of Burnyeat and Frede. Fine agrees with Burnyeat that belief requires taking something as true. However, she disagrees with *both* Frede and Burnyeat on sceptics and truth. Both Burnyeat and Frede agree that the sceptics “don’t claim to take anything to be true”, and thus they agree where it matters most to Fine.[^5]

## III: Fine on *PH* I 13 and related passages

In this section Fine goes through *PH* I 13 and associated texts carefully. She offers a combination of translation and explication. I’ll follow along in order to have a sense of how she understands this central text.

First, her translation. Note that Fine adds labels (A) and (B) “for ease of exposition” (88, note 26).

> (A) When we say that the sceptic does not *dogmatizein*, we do not use *dogma* in the more general sense (*koinoteron*) in which some say that *dogma* is acquiescing in (*eudokein*) something, for the sceptic assents (*sunkatatithetai*) to the affections (*pathe*) forced upon him by an appearance (*kata phantasian*). For example, he would not say, when heated (*thermainomenos*) (or chilled: *psuchomenos*), ‘*dokō* I am not heated (or: chilled)’. (B) Rather, we say that he does not *dogmatizein* in the sense in which some say that *dogma* is assent to some unclear object of investigation in the sciences. For Pyrrhonists do not assent to anything unclear.”

Fine picks out as key points (i) that in (A) Sextus says that sceptics do have *dogmata* if to have a *dogma* is to acquiesce in (*eudokein*) something and (ii) that in (B) the sceptics have no *dogmata* insofar as a *dogma* is an assent to some unclear object of investigation in the sciences because “sceptics do not assent to anything unclear, period” (89). She puts off discussing the example Sextus gives in (A) for the moment.

Fine proposes to consider two different issues that this section raises. She notes that to assent or *dogmatizein* is to be in a cognitive condition and that a *dogma* is the content of this cognitive condition. Hence, the two questions that Fine wants to answer about *PH* I 13: (i) “what *cognitive conditions* are at issue here? In particular, when a sceptic assents, does she have a belief, as we are understanding belief?” (89); (ii) “what is the *content* of sceptical *dogmata*?” (89)

Before taking up those two questions, however, Fine briefly compares I 13 with several other nearby passages.
1. First, *PH* I 19-20:
> Those who say that the sceptics reject what is apparent (*ta phainomena*) have not, I think, listened to what we say. As we said before, we do not overturn the things which lead us, without our willing it, to assent in accordance with a passive appearance (*kata phantasian pathētikēn*); and these things are precisely what is apprent (*ta phainomena*). When we investigate whether underlying things are such as they appear, we grant (*didomen*) that they appear, and what we investigate is not what is apparent but what is said about what is apparent—and this is different from investigating what is apprent itself. [20] For example, it appears to us that honey sweetens (*phainetai hēmin glukazein to meli*): we concede (*sunchōroumen*) this inasmuch as we are sweetened perceptually (*glukazometha aisthetikōs*). But we investigate whether it is sweet (as far as the argument goes)—and this is not what is apparent but something said about what is apparent.
1. Then, I 21:
> That we attend to what is apparent (*hoti de tois phainomenois prosexhomen*) is clear from what we say about the criterion of the sceptical way.
1. Last, I 22—which partly explains I 21:
> We say, then, that the criterion of the sceptical way is what is apparent (*to phainomenon*), implicitly meaning (*dunamei*) by this the appearance of it (*tēn phantasian autou*). For it consists in a passive and unwilled affection; and it is not an object of investigation (*azētētos*). Hence no-one, presumably, will raise a controversy over whether an underlying thing appears this way or that; rather, they investigate whether it is such as it appears.

Fine uses these three passages to make two points about I 13. First, Fine wants to show that when Sextus speaks of assenting to *pathe* or *phainomena*, he really means assenting to *phantasiai*. Second, Fine argues that the assent that Sextus discusses is propositional. The sceptic assents *that* something appears in such-and-such a way.

## IV: Back to the two questions about *PH* I 13

Fine now returns to her two questions about I 13: (i) what cognitive condition is the sceptic in when she assents—and in particular, is she in a belief state; (ii) what is the content of sceptical *dogmata*.

On the first question, Fine notes that there is no quick solution. We cannot say simply this: (i) Sextus says that sceptics can have *dogmata*, (ii) “*dogma*” means “belief”, therefore (iii) sceptics have beliefs. This road is blocked since even if we translate *dogma* as “belief”, this does not yet answer the deeper questions. For example, Barnes, Burnyeat, and Frede all agree that a sceptic has *dogmata*, but they disagree over whether *dogma* implies taking something to be true. (Barnes and Burnyeat argue that it does; Frede denies this.) Fine agrees with Barnes and Burnyeat, but she doesn’t want to get into a “detailed sudy of how ‘*dogma*’ is standardly used” (92). Fine also points out that regardless of the normal meaning of “*dogma*”, Sextus might use the word in a non-standard manner. (As Fine points out, this is precisely what Barnes concludes.)

Fine considers two other words in the passage, but decides that they also are not enough to answer her questions. First Fine discusses acquiesce (*eudokein*). The word is almost never used in philosophical contexts, as Frede points out. By itself, it can range from something very minimal, like “acquiesce in”, to something far stronger, like “rejoice in”. Sextus says that the sceptics acquiesce “because, or in that (*gar*), they sometimes assent”. Assent is *sunkatatithesthai*, and for the Stoics, this word certainly implies taking to be true. However, we can’t be sure that Sextus uses the word in its Stoic sense.

Rather than rely on any one of these three terms, or combinations of them, Fine proposes to “look at the logic of the passage as a whole”. The terms, alone or taken together, don’t settle the matter.

## V: The logic of the passage

Fine begins by interpreting what Sextus says in section (B). According to Fine, Sextus says there (i) that sceptics don’t assent to any unclear object of investigation in the sciences and (ii) that sceptics don’t assent to anything unclear, full stop. However, this does not necessarily mean that sceptics don’t assent to anything, full stop. For sceptics may think that there are things that are clear. According to Fine, the sceptics do think that some things are clear.

How does Sextus understand the claim that something is clear? Fine gives two senses of clarity. First, Fine uses *M* VIII 316  to explain that something is clear “just in case it is ‘grasped involuntarily through a *phantasia* and *pathos*’” (95). Second, Fine uses *M* VIII 322 to show that something is clear “just in case it is ‘agreed by all and admits of no dispute’” (95-96). Finally, she notes that *PH* I 13 and I 19-20 and 22 oppose “being clear, on the one hand, and being a matter of investigation, on the other” (96).

What is clear, in the relevant senses, is how things appear to one. That is, the sceptics assent to claims about how things appear to them. In fact, as Fine specifies, they “can’t help but assent” in such cases (96). Such assent is automatic and necessary. Furthermore, what they assent to, in such cases, is not a matter for dispute in the eyes of the sceptics. Fine cites the example give in *PH* I 20: the sceptic assents to an appearance of honey as sweet. This appearance is clear and not a matter fit for investigation. What *is* unclear and *is* fit for investigation is whether honey actually is sweet. The sceptic does not assent to this further fact, though the sceptic might investigate the question.

As a result of this argument, Fine believes that sceptics have genuine beliefs. That is, the sceptics take as true their views that they have such-and-such appearances. She argues that this interpretation makes good sense of I 19-20 as well as I 13. In a nutshell, I 13 runs as follows: (A) sceptics have *dogmata* about their experiences, which are clear; (B) but the sceptics lack *dogmata* about what is unclear (especially philosophical investigations?).

As a last item in this section, Fine says that, on her view, Sextus does not distinguish to senses of *dogma*, one broader and one more narrow. Instead, Sextus distinguishes between “two ranges of propositions” (97). Sceptics assent to what is clear (one range), but they reject what is unclear (the second range).

## VI: Objections 

Fine considers four objections to her interpretation of I 13:
1. Sextus uses ‘*dogma*’ in a non-standard way. According to this objection, ‘*dogma*’ is not appropriate for belief in general, but only for “especially weighty beliefs, such as those at issue in (B)” (97).
1. Sextus describes sceptical assent as passive, but for the Stoics assent must be active, a choice for which we are responsible.
1. Sextus gives an example that is negative, and Barnes “takes this to mean that sceptical *dogmata* are not any sort of belief, but the absence of belief” (99).
1. Sextus sometimes says that sceptics suspend judgement about everything, that they lack *dogmata* about everything.

In reply, Fine argues thus:
1. There are Hellenistic uses of ‘*dogma*’ for belief as such, even if the word is often used for weighty, theory-laden beliefs.
1. Regardless of the Stoics, many people think that belief, or some beliefs, can be passive. And since Sextus focuses on especially clear beliefs, it especially makes sense for him to think of assent as something that simply happens. There is very little cognitive friction (my term) in such cases.
1. Sextus gives a negative example in I 13, but positive examples in I 19-20. He does not commit himself anywhere to the idea that sceptical *dogmata* are essentially or always negative.
1. Although Sextus does often say that sceptics have no *dogmata*, but we can interpret him to mean that they have no *dogmata* of the forbidden kind. A sceptic has no *dogmata* about unclear matters of investigation, but perhaps Sextus does not always make sure to add the specification “about unclear matters of investigation”.

## Appendix: Fine on Frede on belief

Although she ultimately rejects his view, Fine spends a great deal of time going over several ways to understand what Michael Frede thinks about belief. She does this, I think, for two reasons. First, he is an important voice in an ongoing debate, and so she wants to handle him charitably. Second, she wants to make sure that she doesn’t skim over or ignore something of philosophical value, even if it’s harder to see or less obvious.

[^1]: Fine leaves δόγμα, δόξα, and their cognates transliterated; she doesn’t translate them.

[^2]: In the light of work by Frede, Barney, and Morrison (among others?), I think that Fine’s approach is far too narrow. Unless we have a sense of the philosophical background for what Sextus says, we are likely to misunderstand it completely.

[^3]: See the citations in note 3, page 83.

[^4]: See page 86, where Fine worries that “if we expand the notion of belief beyong the limits of the standard view, to include every sort of acceptance attitude, we stretch the notion too far for it to be useful, thereby obscuring important distinctions.”

[^5]: Burnyeat and Frede disagree, of course, over whether the sceptic has beliefs, but that is only because they have different understandings of “belief”. Beneath that verbal disagreement, Fine locates a deeper agreement—an agreement that she will challenge in turn.
