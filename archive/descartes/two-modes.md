> And for the following reason they do not concede either that anything can be apprehended by means of another thing. If that by means of which something is apprehended will itself always need to be apprehended by means of another thing, they throw one back on the reciprocal or the infinite mode; and if one should want to assume that that by means of which another thing is apprehended is itself apprehended by means of itself, this is met by the fact that, for the above reasons, nothing is apprehended by means of itself (183).
