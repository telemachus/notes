# *Racism: A Short History* by George M. Fredrickson

## Chapter One: Religion and the Invention of Racism

Fredrickson argues that we find the seeds of modern racism in a religious
context in late medieval Europe.  Christianity always had a difficult
relationship with Jews who did not convert, but things grew worse in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  Some Christians demonized Jews; they
claimed that Jews killed Christian children for their rituals or abused
consecrated hosts.  Christians also began to strongly associate Jews with the
devil, to consider them subhuman.  Some people also blamed the Black Death
(1346 to 1353) on Jews, who supposedly poisoned wells to create the plague.
In addition, as explorers became familiar with people further and further from
Europe, some Europeans assumed or developed attitudes of superiority to the
indigenous peoples that they encountered.  These negative attitudes towards
Jews and non-Europeans sometimes took on what Fredrickson considers
a distinctive and essential component: the notion that the differences were
hereditary and unchangeable.

However, Fredrickson also argues that Christianity prevented a truly
systematic, universalizing form of racism.  Officially, the Catholic church
and other religious groups still maintained the universal message of the
gospel.  According to this vision, all humans were essentially the same (made
by god, in his image, etc.), and all people could be and should be converted.
Whoever converted deserved all the rights of any other Christian.  Of course,
this ideal vision was not always honored.  At times we see clear ideas of
“purity of blood” as necessary for full rights.  In addition, some people
denied that Jews or some non-Europeans could truly convert to Christianity.
Nevertheless, Fredrickson maintains that medieval Christianity prevented the
full flowering of racism as he understands it.  That would come later, though
as he acknowledges, we see its beginnings in medieval Europe.


## Chapter Two: The Rise of Modern Racism(s)

Fredrickson begins where he ended.  In the late medieval and early modern
periods, some people believed “that differences between Christians and Jews or
between Europeans and Africans were ineradicable” (51).  Thus, those people
“embrac[ed] a racist doctrine” (52).  However, church and secular authorities
mostly resisted these doctrines.  Instead, they maintained a universalism that
made it difficult for racism to fully flower.  If all humans were the
descendants of Adam and Eve, who were created by god in his image, then
salvation was available to all humans.  Some people in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries suggested polygenesis, but “biblical literalism” held
back such theories (52).  Fredrickson reminds us that racist ideology was held
back by religion and that secularization would unleash a full, ideological
racism.

According to Fredrickson “[t]he modern concept of races as basic human types
classified by physical characteristics (primarily skin color) was not invented
until the eighteenth century” (52-53).  However, he also notes that the word
*race* had some uses that helped lead to the modern concept.  He points out
the use of the word *race* in contexts of animal breeds as well as noble
families.  In both contexts, we see ideas of sub-types within a species that
can be ranked and whose continuity was tracked through blood and breeding.
These notions reappear in the racist context of *race*.  The word *race* also
implied “stable and presumably unchangeable characteristics” (53).  This too
is essential for racism.

Fredrickson notes that during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
we see the beginnings of modern racism, but it takes time for it to fully
develop.  In North America, only black people were enslaved, but not all black
people were enslaved.  In fact, some black people were free precisely because
they were Christian.  Similarly, the lives of Jewish people improved somewhat
during this period.  However, the improvements were very unevenly distributed.
A small number of Jews became enormously wealthy, but the vast majority of
Jews remained desperately poor and separate from the rest of society.

Depressingly, the rise of sciences like biology and anthropology during the
Enlightenment helped modern racism develop.  Scientists and scholars eagerly
tried to divide the human race into distinct types.  Carl Linnaeus, for
example, came up with a familiar-sounding group: Europeans, Native Americans,
Asians, and Africans.  He also characterized these groups in familiar ways:
Europeans were “acute” and “governed by laws,” but Africans were “indolent”
and “governed by caprice” (56).

As Fredrickson argues, these scholars and scientists helped to create secular
racism.  They considered human beings to be one of many animals rather than
unique and divinely-made descendants of a loving god.  These same Enlightened
scholars rushed in to explain the differences between the races they perceived
in pseudo-scientific ways.  Some argued that the climate caused races to
differ.  Others argued that the larger environment was the cause.  For
example, Buffon argued that Europeans were smarter than Africans because they
had to be.  Since Europeans had to struggle to provide food for themselves by
farming, they became more intelligent.  Since Africa naturally provided so
much, Africans became larger, heavier, and less intelligent.  (Note to self:
this sounds so much like modern evolutionary anthropology to me.)  Fredrickson
notes that theories of environmental change leave open the possibility of
improvement.  But there are two problems.  First, no one had any idea how long
that might take.  Second, people remained convinced that as things stand,
non-Europeans are superior.

Fredrickson makes and aside to discuss the “purely aesthetic aspect of
eighteenth-century racial attitudes” since he believes that scholars have not
discussed these enough (59).  He cites “Greek and Roman statuary” and the
“milky whiteness of marble” as a cause of the common belief that Europeans and
lighter skin were more beautiful than other peoples and (especially) darker
skin.  However, I wonder whether he has cause and effect backwards.  I suspect
that there was enough information in the eighteenth century that art
historians and classical scholars should have known better.  That is, they
should have known that these statues were not originally white.  Thus, if they
insisted on whiteness as a mark of beauty, they were already in the grip of
a socially constructed view of beauty.  The statues did not necessarily cause
racist aesthetic theories; racist aesthetic theories may have led to a false
view of the statues themselves.

Fredrickson helpfully discusses the relationship between popular racism and
intellectual or theoretical racism.  On the one hand, he notes that popular
racism can develop without much, or any, support from intellectual or
theoretical racism (61).  On the other hand, he points out that intellectual
or theoretical racism may develop but still have little, or no, effect on
popular attitudes.  He uses Voltaire as an example.  Voltaire was utterly
racist against both Jews and black people, but this was not a significant
legacy of his work (61-63).

Voltaire reminds me of another important point: reason cannot save us.  I like
to imagine reason leading people away from irrationality towards objectivity,
truth, and understanding.  However, as Fredrickson notes, “No thinker better
illustrates the dual character of Enlightenment rationalism—its simultaneous
challenge to hierarchies based on faith, superstition, and prejudice and the
temptation it presented to create new ones allegedly based on reason, science,
and history” (63).

In sum, according to Fredrickson, the Enlightenment pulled in two directions.
On the one hand, Enlightenment thinkers denied a form of universalism backed
by the bible and religion, and they set the stage for nineteenth-century
scientific racism.  On the other hand, these same thinkers argued strenuously
for an earthly equality for all, or at least an equality for more of the
people than in previous periods.  Obviously, “equality for all” was capable of
existing with slavery, enormous gaps in wealth, and the denial of rights for
women, and non-citizens.  Nevertheless, the Enlightenment created the
conditions that led more and more groups to fight for their piece of the pie.

Fredrickson distinguishes the development of racism under different types of
eighteenth-century nationalism.  In countries like the United States and
France, we see civic nationalism: (notionally) universal equality for all
under law without basis in ethnicity, language, or race.  This means that you
cannot rely on old world distinctions in class as in, e.g., Great Britain.
Instead, polygenesis was popular in such countries because it provided
justification for distinguishing between different races.  On such a basis,
people could argue that universal equality only applied to people of some
races.  In places like Germany, we find ethic nationalism.  The nation is
based on shared language, culture, and ethnicity.  In this context, racism
does need to rely on polygenesis.  Instead, racism relies directly on
differences in language, culture, and ethnicity.

Fredrickson seems to assume that racism will happen no matter what, though he
does not discuss this explicitly.  Earlier in the book, for example,
Fredrickson quotes two scholars who describe racism as a “scavenger ideology”
(8, citing John Solomos and Les Back).  Later in the book, Fredrickson quotes
two other scholars who argue that “racism must, in their words become a ‘a
political project’ that ‘*creates or reproduces structures of domination based
on essentialist categories of race*’” (75, citing Michael Omi and Howard
Winant, emphasis in Fredrickson).  In several contexts, he seems to assume
that there is always racist energy, so to speak, and the only question is how
a given historical time and place realizes that energy.  Alternatively, there
is no such thing as racist energy, but there is always (often? generally?)
a desire to dominate? On this view, racism is simply a convenient and popular
tool, but the real goal is domination.  One or both theories may be fine, but
I’d like to think about them more.

Fredrickson devotes the last twenty pages of this chapter to a comparison
between the history of antisemitism in Germany and anti-black racism in the
United States.  There’s a great deal of interest here, but I want to quote one
major conclusion at length.
