# Notes on Brunschwig’s translation of DL IX 61-116

## Introduction

As Brunschwig suggests from his notes (cf. especially note 9 on page 1099 and note 2 on 1100), Diogenes attributes to Pyrrho features of both Academic and Pyrrhonian skepticism. Diogenes does not appear to distinguish between these here. Perhaps Diogenes believes that Pyrrho showed features of both types of skepticism, but I doubt it. This raises some questions: the difference between Academic and Pyrrhonian skepticism was a *topos*, but (i) how accurately did ancients distinguish the two and (ii) when and how clearly did they begin to distinguish between them?

In particular, Diogenes mentions the following (later?) in relation to Pyrrho:

1. Diogenes says that Pyrrho introduced ἀκαταληψία and ἐποχή. The first is Academic, and the second is (primarily?) Pyrrhonian.
1. Diogenes says that Pyrrho denied that things were *en vérité* beautiful or ugly, just or injust. Instead, custom and habit are responsible for our behavior. Deep down, everything is *no more* (οὐ μᾶλλον) this than that. This phrase has a long history, but Sextus shows that later skeptics used it in a very particular way. It is not clear how Diogenes understands Pyrrho’s argument here.

## Manner of life

Brunschwig seems to follow the interpretation that Dorandi gives of Antigonus. Dorandi argues (i) that Antigonus is no philosopher, (ii) that Antigonus profiles his contemporaries, (iii) that Antigonus does not evaluate the people he profiles as philosophers nor in terms of moral character, but (iv) that Antigonus does care about the coherence of a thinker’s theory and life. Thus, in this section, Diogenes begins by saying that Pyrrho was “consistent” in his life and principles.

The stories in §61-64 serve primarily to highlight Pyrrho’s indifference (ἀδιαφορία), which Brunschwig notes was “l’un des maîtres mots de l’éthique pyrrhonienne” (1101).

Brunschwig takes the famous quote of Nausiphanes differently than I had. I always thought it said “You should adopt Pyrrho’s disposition by my (Nausiphanes’s) arguments.” But Brunschwig takes it to be ambiguous between two things, neither of which matches mine:
1. One should adopt Pyrrho’s disposition for Nausiphanes’s reasons, rather than for the reasons that Pyrrho gives.
2. One should adopt Pyrrho’s disposition for ones own reasons. That is, one should reach the same final disposition as Pyrrho, but only after working things out for oneself and for ones own reasons.
(The Loeb, Oxford, and SAPERE translations into English all seem to take the passage the same way that I do.)

## Anecdotes

On §67, Brunschwig argues that when Diogenes says “he compared people to wasps, flies, and birds,” ‘he’ refers to Pyrrho not to Homer. Brunschwig’s argument is that Homer compares people to insects and animals, but he does so in praise of their skill or spirit in combat. Pyrrho compares people to insects or animals to insult them. However, even if Brunschwig is right about the difference between how Homer and Pyrrho use the comparison—and I suspect that he is—that doesn’t affect or determine who the reference of ‘he.’ First, nothing in the passage says anything one way or the other about how the comparison was used by he, whoever he is. Second, Pyrrho may have misunderstood how Homer used the comparison; or Pyrrho may have known perfectly well that he and Homer used the comparison in different ways, but still liked Homer for making the comparison.

## Sceptical names

Brunschwig declares that when Diogenes takes up the various names given to the skeptics (midway through §69), “Ici se termine la notice consacrée à Pyrrhon lui-même. La suite constitue une doxographie générale du scepticisme néo-pyrrhonien” (1107). This seems reasonable, but it also raises some questions. How common is this elsewhere in the book? Why does Diogenes do it here? How good of a “general doxography” is it? Is Diogenes drawing on a source that also combined reflections on Pyrrho with discussion of Pyrrhonians in this way? (If he were, it would explain a lot.)

## Skeptical language

This section corresponds in many ways to *PH* I 187-208, as Brunschwig notes. However, Sextus places this late in his general overview, but Diogenes places it before he gives an account of Pyrrhonism. Brunschwig says that we can justify Diogenes’s choice: “si les sceptiques n’ont pas de doctrines, et si cependant ils parlent et ils écrivent, quel est le sense qu’il faut donner à leurs énoncés?” (1111, note 1).

Brunschwig emends προφέρεσθαι τὰ τῶν ἄλλων καὶ διηγεῖσθαι by removing τὰ τῶν ἄλλων. As a result, instead of Diogenes saying that the skeptics limit themselves to reporting and going through the opinions of other philosophers, he says that the skeptics only speak and tell stories without determining anything. Both are possible things for Diogenes to say, but Brunschwig argues that the latter makes more sense in context. (The Loeb, SAPERE, and Oxford editions of Diogenes in English all keep τὰ τῶν ἄλλων.)

Brunschwig notes, on §76, that Diogenes appears to assert a form of negative dogmatism and that Sextus argues that negative dogmatism, such as that of the Academic skeptics, is *not* true skepticism. On this basis, Brunschwig asks “si Diogène Laërce présente inexactement la même version du scepticisme que [Sextus], ou s’il présente exactement un autre version du scepticisme que lui” (1113, note 3).
