# "The Meaning of Lives," Susan Wolf (in *The Variety of Values: Essays on Morality, Meaning, and Love*, 89-106)

## Meaning of Life

Wolf agrees with the majority view that only some religious view can answer
whether there is a meaning *of* life.  She also agrees with most philosophers
that this is not a question for philosophy proper.

## Meaning in Life

However, Wolf feels that philosophy can and should discuss whether there is
meaning *in* life.

On the one hand, Wolf acknowledges that when we talk about meaning in life, we
seem to look toward "a subjective interpretation of the feature being sought"
(91).  People appear to want something "subjectively rewarding" (91).
Nevertheless, Wolf also notes "that meaningful experiences are not necessarily
particularly happy.  A trip one's birthplace may well be meaningful; a visit
to an amusement park is unlikely to be so" (92).

On the other hand, when we consider the question from a third-personal point
of view, we don't seem to focus on subjective criteria.  According to Wolf, if
someone asked us to name people who led meaningful lives, we would pick people
such as "Gandhi or Albert Schweitzer or Mother Teresa; perhaps Einstein or
Jonas Salk.  Cezanne or Manet, Beethoven or Charlie Parker.  Tolstoy is an
interesting case" (92).

In order to get a better sense of what a meaningful life is, Wolf invites us
to consider lives that are meaningless.  She imagines a person who spends
their days and nights in front of a TV, drinking beer and watching sitcoms.
She describes this as a life of "hazy passivity" (92).  Wolf grants that the
persons internal, subjective experiences may be pleasant, but she also insists
that the person is "unconnected to anyone or anything, going nowhere,
achieving nothing" (92).  Wolf calls such a life "the Blob" (92).

The Blob is idle, but not all meaningless lives are idle.  Wolf offers
additional examples: an idle rich person, a very busy rich corporate
executive, and a pig farmer who is in an endless cycle of expansion. All of
these cases are busy, according to Wolf, but still meaningless.  Wolf says
that all three examples share at least one feature: "[t]hey can all be
characterized as lives whose dominant activities seem pointless, useless, or
empty" (93).  Wolf calls such lives "Useless" (93).

Finally, Wolf considers meaningless lives that she calls "Bankrupt" (93).  In
such cases, the person is busy and their pursuits are meaningful (in theory),
but bad luck or ignorance renders all their work pointless.  Wolf imagines
a person who dedicates their life to a family business, but the business
fails.  She also imagines scientists or doctors whose work fails to yield
successful results (or successful results in time).  Finally, Wolf offers the
example of a spouse whose partner is (somehow) systematically deceiving them.

Wolf uses these meaningless lives to imagine a life that is meaningful.

+ The Blob shows us that passivity is meaningless; a meaningful life must be
  active.
+ The Useless examples show us that a meaningful life cannot pick just
  anything; meaningful lives must aim at goals or projects that matter
  (objectively, it seems).
+ The Bankruptcy examples show us that a meaningful life must succeed although
  we may argue about how much success is required.

As Wolf sums it up, "A meaningful life is one that is actively and at least
somewhat successfully engaged in a project (or projects) of positive value"
(94).

Wolf argues that we should not try to pin down what we mean by "positive
value" (95).  As she says, "We do not want to build a theory of positive value
into our conception of meaningfulness" (95).  However, Wolf nevertheless makes
one exception: she excludes "merely subjective value as a suitable
interpretation of the phrase" (95).  According to Wolf, we must rule out
merely subjective value from creating positive value because otherwise we
"[erase] the distinctiveness of our interest in meaningfulness" (95).

Wolf makes an argument against subjective criteria for meaningfulness that
I do not fully understand.  As I said above, Wolf argues that if we "allow
that a meaningful life is a life involved in projects that *seem* to have
positive value" to the person who lives that life, then we "[erase] the
distinctiveness of our interest in meaningfulness" (95).  She continues, "it
would blur or remove the difference between an interest in living a meaningful
life and an interest in live a life that feels or seems meaningful" (95).  She
goes on to make two claims:

+ An interest in a meaningful life and an interest in a life that feels or
  seems meaningful are distinct.
+ An interest in a meaningful life is not simply "instrumental to" an
  interest in a life that feels or seems meaningful.

I worry that the first claim simply begs the question. Wolf defends the second
claim by pointing to the following kind of epiphany.

> ...in which one wakes up—literally or figuratively—to the recognition that
> one’s life to date has been meaningless.  One can hardly understand the idea
> of waking up to the thought that one's life to date has *seemed*
> meaningless.  To the contrary, it may be that precisely because one did not
> realize the emptiness of one's projects or the shallowness of one's values
> until that moment that the experience I am imagining has the poignancy it
> does.  It is the sort of experience that one might describe in terms of
> scales falling from one's eyes.

I am not certain that Wolf is wrong, but I am not sure that she is right
either.  Perhaps I do not understand her argument fully.  She seems to assume
that it makes no sense to say that we can have an epiphany of how one's life
seems to one, but I disagree.  Surely, we may change in our views (for
whatever reasons), and as a result of those changes we may also see the world
differently.  But we need not believe that any such changes track objective
features of the world.  People often say, e.g., "Everything I thought
mattered no longer seems to matter."  Do we have to take this to be an
assertion that there is an objective fact of the matter?  (Compare, say,
people who come to believe that their current haircut looks terrible on them.
Must Wolf argue that such an epiphany is only possible if there are objective
facts about how haircuts look on people?)

In any case, Wolf argues in such a way that we must assert some objective
features in a meaningful life.

However, Wolf also argues that we should not simply assume that an objectively
meaningful life is a morally good life.  She argues in fact that lives can be
moral but not meaningful.  (Her example is an alienated housewife.  Such
a person lives a perfectly moral but highly meaningless life, according to
Wolf.)  And Wolf also claims that immoral lives can be meaningful.  (She lists
Gauguin, Wittgenstein, and Tchaikovsky as examples.)

Wolf next considers "whether the desire (for a meaningful life) is one that it
is good that people have, whether, that is, there is some positive reason why
they *should* want this" (97).  (NB: Wolf claims that it is an "obvious,
empirical fact" that people do want meaningful lives.  She does not spend any
time arguing for the empirical claim.)

According to Wolf, our recognition of the value of meaning in life should be
more than minimal.  We should not merely allow people to pursue meaning in
their lives.  Instead, "[w]e should positively try to increase opportunities
for people to live lives of meaning" (97).  However, Wolf finds it "somewhat
mysterious" (at least initially) *why* meaningful lives are so valuable: "What
is the good, after all, of living a meaningful life, and to whom?" (97).
Wolf denies that the pursuit of meaningful lives increases moral goodness or
happiness.

Wolf denies that meaningful lives are necessarily better from the standpoint
of morality or happiness.  Again, meaningful lives can be immoral, and they
can also be unhappy or unsuccessful (in ways that don't diminish their
meaningfulness).

Wolf argues that concern for meaning in life is "closer to a prudential
judgment than it is to a moral one" (98).  She insists that someone who leads
a meaningless less does not (*eo ipso*) lead an immoral life.  Wolf believes
that someone who leads a life without meaning may or may not harm others, but
they certainly harm *themselves*.

Wolf connects her diagnosis with Aristotle on *eudaimonia*.  Aristotle,
according to Wolf, believes that the "virtuous life" is the "happiest life"
partly out of "enlightened self-interest" (98).  However, since Aristotle does
not explain why the virtuous life is best for us, Wolf also says that "a
scholarly study of Aristotle's texts is not likely" to help us answer the
problem about meaning in life (99).

Wolf answers her central problem by saying that merely subjective value is
"practically solipsistic" (99).  She believes that the key problem is to show
people that they should have "reason to care that one's projects be positively
valuable" (99).  We should not be satisfied with things just because we find
our projects engaging and they make us happy.  If we stop there, we act as
though we were the only person in the universe—or perhaps more accurately as
if we were somehow special or distinct from everyone and everything else.
Instead, Wolf claims that we should acknowledge that we are each "a tiny speck
in a vast universe, a universe with countless perspectives of equal status
with one's own, from which one's life might be assessed" (99).  In a nutshell,
it seems either silly, solipsistic, or massively unlikely to think that *I*
happen to be the only thing that matters out of all the things that exist.

Wolf admits two weaknesses in her argument.  First, a person can deny the
facts, as Wolf see them, without inconsistency or logical flaws.  Second,
a person can deny the facts, as Wolf sees them, but they may not suffer any
practical consequences.  (Wolf contrasts the second case with someone who
denies the truth of physics, geography, and the other sciences.  Such a person
runs great risks, and thus the sciences have instrumental value for us.)
Because of these two admissions, Wolf says, that a person who denies objective
value "cannot be accused in any strict sense of irrationality" (101).
Nevertheless, Wolf claims that her argument (and Nagel's parallel argument
about morality) appeal "to reason in a broader sense" (101).

Finally, Wolf argues that although she agrees with pessimists such as Richard
Taylor and Thomas Nagel that (without god) there cannot be a meaning of life
(as a whole) there can be meaningful lives.  This argument is not entirely
clear to me, and I will need to come back to it later.
