## Preface

The preface is tiny. The editors say that they are primarily focused on
Plato's Socrates, but that some essays look to other sources as well.
They instructed authors to present and evaluate contemporary views on their
topic, but also to present their own opinion. As such, different chapters
may differ and the editors do not necessarily support any particular
chapter as such.

## Chapter 1: The quest for the historical Socrates (Robin Waterfield)

Waterfield makes a compelling case that all contemporary attempts to
discover the *real* or *historical* Socrates are flawed. In fact, he
convinced me that no such investigation could possibly succeed given the
nature of our evidence. He suprised the hell out of me, however, by
offering his own *real* Socrates in the final part of the essay. Although
readers should judge for themselves, I find his reconstruction to be as
flawed and full of wish-fulfillment as the ones he criticizes earlier in
the essay.

## Chapter 2: Socratic Irony (Iakovos Vasiliou)

Vasiliou begins by observing that when we read Plato, we inevitably and
frequently ask questions like, "Is Socrates serious?" However, "the
possibility of wondering whether Aristotle or Kant is serious does not
arise; there is almost no space for that question to be intelligible."
Vlastos argues that this shows the manifest reality of some kind of play in
the case of Plato's Socrates. As he argues repeatedly, even if someone's
final interpretation is that Socrates *is* serious, this would need to be
*argued for* in the case of Socrates, and unlike (most) other philosophers.

Vasiliou then analyzes two main types of Socratic irony. Conditional irony,
which usually appears in Socrates' hyperbolic praise of his interlocutors,
involves a suppressed protasis: Socrates wants desperately to become Euthyphro's
student, *if Euthyphro knows what he claims to know about piety*. In these
cases, Socrates inevitably denies the implied antecedent, and by
implication, he denies the entire condition as well. (As Vasiliou points
out, this is formally a fallacy, but it is in line with normal
conversational implications: "I'll go to the movies with you, if I finish
studying for the test" is, in normal conversations, defeated by my not
finishing my studying, even if by logic this is a fallacy.) The other type
of irony is reverse irony, which usually appears when Socrates disavows
knowledge or asserts one of the Socratic paradoxes. In these cases,
Socrates provokes his interlocutors (and Plato's readers) by being
completely honest but saying something that listeners and readers are bound
to find impossible.

Vasiliou's analyses of these cases is very strong, but I have one quarrel
with his case. I'm not convinced that he has answered a problem raised by
Charles Griswold. Griswold notes that in many cases the audience for
Socratic irony must be Plato's readers and not any character internal to
the dialogues. If this is so, and Vasiliou seems to agree that it is---at
least in some cases---then the irony belongs to Plato rather than to
Socrates. It becomes part of Plato's communication with his readers rather
than anything Socrates communicates to anyone. Vasiliou seems to recognize
this partly, but he also wants to have it both ways. He argues that Plato
allows Socratic irony to have an audience that Socrates never finds in the
dialogues, an audience of us---Plato's readers. But that simply sounds to
me like a roundabout way of saying something that Vasiliou is at pains to
deny: much of the irony he covers is Platonic not Socratic.(ft. This issue
is complex. Vasiliou admits initially that in some sense *all* of the irony
is Platonic since he is the author of all of these words. However, he
insists that the irony he discusses throughout also belongs in an important
sense to Socrates the character. I don't think that he can make good on
that claim, ultimately.)

## Chapter 3: Socratic Philosophizing

Wolfsdorf considers a cluster of problems about Socratic method. Following
Vlastos, he begins with the Socratic elenchus, and he considers such
questions as these: Is the elenchus constructive or only destructive? Is
Socrates entitled to think that the elenchus can disprove specific theses
or can it only show inconsistency among a set of theses? Is the elenchus
Socrates' only method? Does Socrates investigate propositions or lives?
Does Socrates pursue truth via the elenchus (or any other method) or does
he only seek to display ignorance? Is the elenchus adversarial or
cooperative?

Unlike all the other contributions to the volume, Wolfsdorf arranges his
essay temporally. He examines 21 essays by various scholars in the order
they were published, and one by one he unpacks their views on his topic. He
does not present his own views or any summary views, and so the chapter is
impossible to further summarize. At the end of the essay, Wolfsdorf
recommends that future studies expand in two ways. First, they should move
beyond logic to "consider the psychological attitudes" of the speakers in
the dialogues, remaining open to the possibility that "Plato employs
Socrates and his interlocutors variously in different argumentative
contexts." Second, they should expand consideration of Socratic arguments
beyond the elenchus in order to consider the many other various ways in
which Socrates argues. Wolfsdorf grants that piecemeal work has been done
towards both goals, but he believes that far more work remains in order to
yield real results.

## Chapter 4: Socratic Metaphysics

Prior argues, against Dancy and Vlastos and with Allen and Fine, that the
character Socrates in the early dialogues *is* a metaphysician. He has an
ontology of forms that is in many essential ways similar to, and
a precursor for, the famous Platonic theory of forms that appears in the
middle dialogues.

Prior bases his argument on Socrates' use of the same language for Forms as
the middle period, Socratic arguments that objects like "justice" and
"piety" exist, are universals, explain the properties of actions, people
and so on, serve as standards for thought and action and are
self-predicating. In fact, the metaphysics of the early Socrates shares
everything with Plato except for separation of the Forms and Plato's
general other-worldliness, according to Prior. In this sense, the views we
find in the early dialogues clearly foreshadow and lead to the view of the
middle dialogues.

## Chapter 7: Socratic Eudaimonism (Naomi Reshotko)

Reshotko argues that virtue is knowledge, but this definition can only
apply to people. Notice that in *Hippias Major* 295c8-e3, Socrates argues
for a definition of τὸ καλόν that cannot possibly be knowledge since it
must apply equally to people, animals, objects, boats and fields of study.
And Socrates explicitly says that the definition must apply to all things
"in the same manner" (295d6).

## Chapter 9: Socrates on love (Suzanne Obdrzalek)

Obdrzalek reviews the Socratic theory of love, as found primarily in
Plato's *Lysis*. She begins with an objection by Vlastos that has been
central for later work: Vlastos objects that the Socratic theory is unduly
egoistic and that Socratic does not recognize truly other-regarding love.
Obdrzalek rejects arguments that escape this objection by finding
other-regarding love in the *Lysis*. Instead, she argues that theories of
other-regarding love are themselves problematic. Although I worry that this
amounts to burning down the village in order to save it, she makes serious
criticisms of two modern theories of other-regarding love.
