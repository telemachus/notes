## Preface

The preface is tiny. The editors say that they are primarily focused on
Plato's Socrates, but that some essays look to other sources as well.
They instructed authors to present and evaluate contemporary views on their
topic, but also to present their own opinion. As such, different chapters
may differ and the editors do not necessarily support any particular
chapter as such.

## Chapter 1: The quest for the historical Socrates (Robin Waterfield)

Waterfield makes a compelling case that all contemporary attempts to
discover the *real* or *historical* Socrates are flawed. In fact, he
convinced me that no such investigation could possibly succeed given the
nature of our evidence. He suprised the hell out of me, however, by
offering his own *real* Socrates in the final part of the essay. Although
readers should judge for themselves, I find his reconstruction to be as
flawed and full of wish-fulfillment as the ones he criticizes earlier in
the essay.
