# “The Ten Tropes of Aenesidemus” Gisela Striker, 95-115 in *The Skeptical Tradition* (ed. Myles Burnyeat)

## Introductory material

Striker says that the ten tropes “presumably” go back to Aenesidemus, and she adds, “Very litle is known about Aenesidemus as a person” (95) She thinks he lived in Alexandria, based on Aristocles. She also mentions the testimony of Photius that Aenesidemus dedicated a book to his fellow Academic, the Roman L. Tubero. She continues “this may indicate that he started off as a student of the skeptical Academy, but later decided to argue for a different form of skepticism associated with the name of Pyrrho” (95).[^1] Finally, Striker speculates that “it seems likely that [Aenesidemus] was the first who tried to present a systematic repertoire of Pyrrhonist arguments. The purpose of the systematization would have been to provide the skeptic with an arsenal of weapons against all temptations of dogmatism” (95). Striker places this activity “in the first century” BCE (95).

According to Striker, scholars have not devoted the right kind of attention to the modes. People have studied “their historical origin, order, and number” (96), but they have been brief, dismissive, or misleading about the modes as arguments. In particular, many scholars claim “that they all follow the same strategy, leading to the conclusion that nothing can be found out about the real nature of things because of what is alternatively and indiscriminately called the undecidable conflict between mutually inconsistent views or the relativity of all impressions” (96).

Striker objects that these two arguments cannot be the same thing:
> Now it seems to me that undecidability and relativity can hardly come to the same, since the first leaves open the possibility that one of the conflicting views may be right, while the other seems to imply either that nothing is absolutely or unrestrictedly true or at least that none of the “relative” impressions can be. So either there must be more than one strategy, or the common strategy is not as easily detectable as commentators seem to think (96).

I’m not sure if Striker is right, and I’m also not sure whether the ancients would have agreed with her, whether or not she’s right. In particular, some ancients seem to believe that relativism is a source of undecidable conflict. As such, even if they do not “come to the same,” as Striker says, these ancients tend to run them together. And it’s easy enough to see why they might do so. Imagine that Plato, for example, wants to know the real color of this book, what color it actually is, the truth about its color. One the one hand, he might encounter undecidable conflict: you say it is red, and I say it is orange. On the other hand, a third person may try to relativize this conflict. This third person points out that I am colorblind in such a way that red things appear yellow to me. So the object is red to you and orange to me, says the third person to Plato. How will Plato feel about this? Is this progress over undecidable conflict? Or is it simply a way of spelling out the very same conflict, in his eyes?

Striker, as well as Annas and Barnes in *The Modes of Scepticism*, want to insist that there *is* a difference. On the relative interpretation, it is simply true that the book is red for you and simply true that it is orange for me. Both views are true, and there is no conflict. Hence, there is no undecidable disagreement. In addition, they might want to add that relativism takes up a question in metaphysics—roughly “How do truths about the world work?”—while undecidable conflict is about epistemology—roughly “What can we know about the world?”

But it is not clear to me that the ancients agree. Plato, Aristotle, and the skeptics tend to run these sorts of questions together. They want an answer to questions like “What is the nature of *x*?” or “What is *x* like in itself(, in reality, in truth, actually)?” They do not seem to accept relativism as a proper or satisfactory answer to their questions. Hence, they do not seem to agree that relativism settles anything that undecidable conflict leaves open.

## Origin, order, and number

Striker handles these issues only briefly since her main concern is the content and structure of the tropes, not their history. Some key points from her discussion of the history follow. Everything below is Striker’s assertion unless I specifically say otherwise.

+ We have three accounts of the ten modes: Philo in *On Drunkenness* 169-202[^2]; Diogenes Laertius IX 79-88[^3]; Sextus Empiricus *PH* I 36-163. Aristocles (in Eusebius *Praep. Ev.* XIV 18.9-10[^4]) gives a very brief overview.
+ Philo doesn’t number his modes, but he seems to have only eight; Diogenes and Sextus have ten, and they state that Aenesidemus had ten; Aristocles says that Aenesidemus had nine. There were many lists going around with different orders; there were usually, but not always, ten modes. Philo and Aristocles may have seen lists with less, but Philo may have left out some too for his own reasons. (Aristocles takes a specific stance that there were nine, so he doesn’t seem to have knowingly omitted one. What Aristocles says isn’t concrete enough for us to decide which one from the canonical ten he doesn’t have.)
+ Diogenes tells us that Sextus, Aenesidemus, and Favorinus used a different order from his own. Thus, he is unlikely to be using any of them as his primary source. Also, Diogenes gives an order for Sextus that is different from the order in *PH*. (Me: Perhaps he is using the equivalent of *PH* I from *AM*? It’s missing for us, but perhaps Diogenes used it.)
+ Many of the examples go back as far as Democritus and Protagoras.
+ The account of Diogenes is shortest, and that in Sextus is the longest.
+ Sextus makes use of the five modes of Agrippa in his account of the ten modes, so presumably Sextus does not base his account only on Aenesidemus. (Neither Philo nor Diogenes do this. Maybe Sextus himself came up with this as an innovation.)
+ Only Richter and Stough have analyzed the modes in detail. Richter subsumes all the modes under relativism. Stough says that they all follow one strategy, but she actually describes two types of argument. According to Richter, the skeptics attack the consequences of, what he calls, naive realism. By ‘naive realism,’ Richter means the view that appearances “must be exact images of what they represent” if we want to learn the truth about things (98). For Stough, the skeptics attack something like the Stoic theory of perception, a theory “which is aimed at discovering reality behind or through appearances (sense-impressions), but which defines perception in such a way as to make the attainment of this aim impossible” (98). However, these interpretations of the modes both have a problem: if they are right about what Sextus is doing, then Sextus is doing it in the wrong place. An argument “against a specific philosophical position” doesn’t belong in Book I. Such an argument belongs “according to Sextus Empiricus (*PH* I 5-6), to the special (*eidikos*) part of the Pyrrhonist exposition” (98). I.e., it would go in Book II or II of *PH*.
+ There are two types of argument in the modes, but neither “coincides with the classical argument of modern skepticism based on the representative theory of perception” (98).


[^1]: Note how tentative Striker is here. Many writers now take it for granted that Aenesidemus began as an Academic, grew disillusioned with the dogmatism of the later Academy, and returned to a more radical, Pyrrhonian form of skepticism.

[^2]: Annas and Barnes give 169-205 for Philo.

[^3]: Annas and Barnes give 78-88 for Diogenes Laertius.

[^4]: This is what Striker says, but the actual reference to the modes is 18.11-12. (Annas and Barnes give 11-12.)
