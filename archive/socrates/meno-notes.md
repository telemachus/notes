# Meno notes

## Opening question: How is ἀρετή acquired?

Meno begins abruptly, asking Socrates, "Ἔχεις μοι εἰπεῖν, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἆρα διδακτὸν ἡ ἀρετή; ἢ οὐ διδακτὸν ἀλλ᾽ἀσκητόν; ἢ οὔτε ἀσκητὸν οὔτε μαθητόν, ἀλλά φύσει παραγίγνεται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἢ ἄλλῳ τινὶ τρόπῳ;" (70a1-4). As Nehamas notes,[^1] the question was familiar from Sophistical debates. And the answer mattered a great deal. Most Greeks of the age would desire ἀρετή, and there were many people claiming to provide it.

Socrates replies that he cannot answer Meno's question. He offers heavy (and presumably ironic) praise of the Thessalians and the teaching that they've picked up from Gorgias, but he explains that things are very different in Athens, where there is a "kind of drought of wisdom" (70c4). If Meno asks an Athenian his question, he will be met with laughter and a ignorance. The Athenians cannot say how ἀρετή is taught, and they do not even know at all (τὸ παράπαν) what ἀρετή is (71a). Socrates too cannot answer these questions: he claims to be as poor off as the rest of the Athenians (71b1-3). 

Socrates then states the priority of definition rule: ὃ δὲ μὴ οἶδα τί ἐστιν, πῶς ἂν ὁποῖόν γέ τι εἰδείην; (71b3-4). It is not possible to know what something is like (ποῖος) if you do not know what it is (τί). To help explain this rule, he gives an example, asking Meno: Does it seem possible that someone who has no idea who Meno is know whether meno is handsome or wealthy or noble (71b4-8)?

Although he agrees with the priority of definition rule, and the example Socrates gives, Meno is shocked that Socrates disavows knowledge of ἀρετή. I think his shock is twofold. First, it's a pretty bald admission, in Meno's eyes, that Socrates doesn't possess ἀρετή. This by itself is bold in Greece at that time. But Meno also sees how completely Socrates disavows knowledge, I think, and that seems to run against Meno's notion that *everyone* who is at all competent knows what ἀρετή is. Meno cannot imagine that there is any real question about *what* it is, only how best to acquire ἀρετή.

Socrates assures Meno that he doesn't know and that, moreover, he's never met anyone who does. Meno says "Not even Gorgias?" In reply to this, Socrates says that he he is forgetful (Οὐ πάνυ εἰμὶ μνήμων 71c8)—surely a joke given the later importance of recollection—but that perhaps Gorgias did know. Since Meno is very familiar with Gorgias' opinions perhaps he can speak for Gorgias and tell Socrates what ἀρετή is? Socrates will be very fortunate if he turns out to be wrong and Gorgias and others do know the definition of ἀρετή. In fact, since Meno must agree with Gorgias, they can leave Gorgias to one side and Meno himself can tell Socrates the definition. Meno agrees and this leads to the first elenchus.

## First elenchus

Meno replies confidently, but his answer shows that he doesn't fully understand what Socrates wants from an answer. (This isn't to his discredit since Socrates hasn't done anything to make this clear yet. As often in Socratic dialogues, the initial fumble seems partly aimed at Plato's readers. We too need to learn what sorts of questions and answers matter.) Meno offers a laundry list of commonplace examples of ἀρετή, and he breaks these down by gender, age and status. A male citizen should be capable of handling the matters of his city, he should help his friends and harm his enemies. A woman should manage her household well. And so on, elliptically, for young and old, slave and free.

Socrates explain by analogy that he wants the "one over the many". Since Meno has given him a "swarm" (σμῆνος) of virtues, Socrates brings up bees. He says that there are many different types of bees, but nevertheless, they share some one thing in virtue of which they are all bees. In respect to this thing, all bees are the same, no matter if they differ in size or any other quality. Meno agrees, and Socrates explains that *this* is what he wants as an answer to his question about ἀρετή.[^2]

Meno follows but not fully, and so Socrates gives further examples. Socrates asks whether health, size, and strength differs for a man and a woman or if health itself is the same thing whether it is a man or woman who is healthy. Meno agrees in these cases that there is a one over the many, but he still hesitates in the case of ἀρετή.

Socrates tries to show Meno that all people possess ἀρετή in the same way:

1. A man should govern his city well and a woman should govern her house well.
1. To govern well, whether a city or a house, a person must govern prudently and with justice.
1. Both man and woman therefore require the same things—prudence and justice—in order to govern well.
1. Likewise young or old people become good only if they are prudent and just.
1. Therefore, since all people are good in the same way—namely through possession of prudence and justice—then the ἀρετή they possess must be the same thing.

Meno is not thrilled with this, but he concedes and offers a new definition in light of Socrates' argument. He now defines ἀρετή as the ability to rule people. (This was probably suggested to him by Socrates though I don't know that this was what Socrates intended by his previous argument.)

Socrates appears to accept the form of the answer this time, but he shoots down its content. He reminds Meno that his definition will not apply to children or slaves. Thus, the definition is too narrow: it cannot cover all cases of ἀρετή. Socrates also asks whether "ruling" is a sufficient definition even for the cases it covers. Do they not need to add "justly" to the definition. Meno agrees, but immediately fumbles by saying that "justice is ἀρετή" (73d9-10).

Socrates asks whether justice is ἀρετή or ἀρετή τις, and this leads to further trouble. Meno initially does not understand. After Socrates explains, using the example of round and shape, Meno gets it. In answer to Socrates, Meno is then able to list several other virtues—thus showing that he knows that justice is not (all of) ἀρετή. However, Socrates complains now they they have once again reached an answer of several ἀρεταί when he only wanted one.[^3]

Socrates returns to shapes—and colors though with less focus. He tells Meno at reasonable length the kind of account he wants, using shape as an example. He then invites Meno to give a "one over the many" account of shape in order to practice for ἀρετή. Meno asks Socrates to do it himself, and Socrates agrees. He defines shape as "that which, alone of all things, always accompanies color", and Socrates adds that he would be happy with a definition from Meno along those lines (75b8-c1).

Meno, however, finds this definition foolish. His reason is somewhat odd. He says that the definition would not help someone who didn't understand what color is. This is true as far as it goes, but it's not clear why it's a problem. Nevertheless, Socrates is willing to give Meno's complaint some time. He distinguishes between eristic (and agonistic) discussion and discussion between friends. In the first case, it would be the interlocutor's business to disprove the definition. But in the second case—a friendly dialogue—then Socrates agrees that they should reply in a gentler and more dialectic manner. Socrates explands the idea of "more dialectic" with this rule:

> A more dialectic answer is not only true but also proceeds through terms that the questioner agrees he knows.

Therefore Socrates is willing to refine his definition of shape. He says that shape is the "limit of a solid" (76a7). Meno then immediately asks Socrates to define color. Socrates gives him some grief, saying that Meno is demanding multiple answers from an old man while refusing to give one answer in return. Nevertheless, Socrates complies. He offers an elaborate (mocking?) definition of color as "the effluence of shape that is fit for and perceptible to sight" (76d4-5q.

[^2]: Note that Socrates uses the terms οὐσία (72b2) and εἶδος (72c7) when explaining what he wants.

[^3]: I don't think that the complaint is fair here. Meno was simply replying to Socrates' request for him to list other ἀρεταί just as he could list other shapes than round. Meno was *not* offering this list as an answer to the original question "What is ἀρετή?"
