[Authors and titles are listed at the end of the review.]

Although it enters a crowded field, this new companion to Socrates will be
very welcome to scholars. The book aims "to assemble a comprehensive guide
to the main issues engaged in the philosophy of Socrates" (vi). These
essays fulfill that aim admirably. I will first consider how this volume
compares to the two other Socratic companions already in print and then
discuss individual chapters. At the end, I will provide a list of errata.

Despite obvious overlap, each of the three companions to Socrates has its
own particular strength. Blackwell's <i>A Companion to Socrates</i>[[1]]
has the broadest range of viewpoints and topics. Its authors are not all
philosophers or Classicists, and it includes essays on subjects such as
Socrates in art, in Arabic philosophy, in the Renaissance and in relation
to psychoanalysis and modern education. <i>The Cambridge Companion to
Socrates</i>[[2]] and the companion under review are similar in topics and
approach. In fact, eight topics and two authors appear in both volumes.
However, they still differ greatly in audience. The Cambridge companion is
well-suited to undergraduates or any reader seeking a clear, brief
introduction to central topics in the philosophy of Socrates. The volume
under review, on the other hand, covers the same topics but provides a far
more detailed look at the last 30 years of scholarship. These reviews of
the literature are quite detailed. Scholars and graduate students will be
glad to have such comprehensive overviews of central Socratic questions all
in one place, but the Bloomsbury companion would overwhelm less experienced
readers. (Greek, however, is never required. The scattered references to
specific words are all transliterated.)

Robin Waterfield opens the book by reviewing the evidence for the
historical figure of Socrates. He makes a forceful case for extreme
scepticism: none of the witnesses can be trusted whether alone or in
combinations. Surprisingly, Waterfield himself still attempts to
reconstruct a picture of the historical Socrates after that. I find his
positive conclusions less convincing than his sceptical arguments, but they
do testify to the persistent desire for a <i>true</i> Socrates.

Iakovos Vasiliou begins his chapter on Socratic irony with what he calls
play. Play is that feature of Plato's Socrates that <i>forces</i> readers
to wonder if Socrates is serious. Vasiliou contrasts this playfulness with
most philosophical writing. As he says, no one asks whether Aristotle or
Kant is serious. The question barely makes sense for such authors. This
suggests to me, though Vasiliou doesn't put it quite this way, that
philosophical readers of Plato who ignore the play face a serious problem.
They cannot say that they care only about truth and the arguments, since if
they ignore the play, they are likely not even to understand what Socrates
actually claims.

David Wolfsdorf's essay considers Socratic methodology, broadly speaking,
with a particular focus on the elenchus. Unlike all the other
contributions, this chapter is completely devoted to reviewing other
scholarship and it proceeds temporally, article by article, through 21
articles. Although at the very end, Wolfsdorf suggests possible paths for
future research, he offers effectively no views of his own. He summarizes
only. I appreciate Wolfsdorf's intention to preserve "the integrity" (35)
of other views, but I wish that he had done more to give the ideas
a narrative arc.

William Prior convincingly argues that Socrates has a metaphysics and that
he he is not only a moral thinker. Using evidence from <i>Euthyphro</i> and
<i>Hippias Major</i>, Prior demonstrates that the Socratic pursuit of
definitions relies on a theory of forms that resembles the more famous
Platonic theory in numerous respects. As such, Prior also argues for
continuity between the early and middle dialogues in this regard rather
than a radical break.

Keith McPartland carefully charts the diverse interpretations of Socratic
ignorance. He also takes seriously Socrates' occasional knowledge claims
and the surprising confidence (even arrogance) that Socrates frequently
displays. According to McPartland, Socrates distinguishes between an
extraordinarily strong cognitive state that he lacks and more everyday
knowledge that he possesses. Although I agree that this can be a logically
consistent position, I'm less convinced that it can be psychologically
stable. Socrates insists that the superhuman cognitive state is
<i>essential</i> for happiness (<i>eudaimonia</i>) and that he (and
everyone he has ever met) does not possess such knowledge. Why does that
not eat away at his arrogance? Why does that not open up sceptical doubts
about even the true beliefs that he holds "based on a warrant sufficient
for unhedged assertion and full confidence" (135)? (I take this to be
a reminder that there remains something very paradoxical about Socrates'
attitudes rather than an argument against McPartland's interpretation.)

Hugh H. Benson makes a strong case that Socrates is committed to
a principle of priority of definition. Roughly: If someone fails to know
what F is, then that person fails to know anything about F. Even more
interestingly, however, Benson argues that many recent denials of this are
based on contemporary philosophical concerns more than what Socrates says.
Benson responds to the philosophical concerns by arguing in favor of the
principle of priority of definition itself. In response to Peter Geach's
famous claim that "We know heaps of things without being able to define"
terms (quoted on 155), Benson relies on something like McPartland's strong
view of knowledge. He argues that we may have justified true beliefs about
such things, but we don't, in a Socratic sense, possess knowledge about
them.

Naomi Reshotko reviews the Socratic understanding of <i>eudaimonia</i>, the
"central value and supreme goal of a human life" (156). According to
Reshotko, Socrates pursues <i>eudaimonia</i> in a practical rather than
a theoretical manner. This leads her to argue that most commentators are
misguided when they seek necessary and sufficient conditions for
<i>eudaimonia</i> in Socratic arguments. Even more radically, Reshotko
argues that Socrates identifies our ultimate goal as omniscience.[[3]] In
an effort to be happy, we should strive to know literally everything.
Reshotko grants that this goal is impossible, but maintains that "Socrates
thought there was a great deal to be gained by trying" (158). I'm honestly
unsure of what to make of this, but the chapter is challenging and
well-worth reading for more traditional interpreters of Socratic ethics.

In the next chapter, Thomas C. Brickhouse and Nicholas D. Smith provide an
exemplary contrast with Reshotko. While Reshotko tries to argue primarily
from what Socrates (and other characters) say without consideration of
contemporary philosophy, Brickhouse and Smith use philosophical
plausibility to drive their interpretation of Socrates' words.[[4]] In this
examination of Socratic moral psychology, for example, they struggle to
make more room than Reshotko for the psychological force of desire. They do
so explicitly because they believe that their interpretation better handles
"the actual phenomena" (196). The result may seem to some readers like
a very weak or attenuated version of motivational <i>intellectualism</i>.
However, Brickhouse and Smith might reasonably reply that when interpreting
<i>a philosopher</i>, charity demands that we consider truth. In any case,
the contrast between this chapter and Reshotko's is instructive and
interesting beyond the specific disagreements.

Suzanne Obdrzalek reviews the Socratic theory of love, as found primarily
in Plato's <i>Lysis</i>. She begins with an objection by Vlastos that has
been central for later work: Vlastos objects that the Socratic theory is
unduly egoistic and that Socrates does not recognize truly other-regarding
love. Obdrzalek rejects arguments that escape this objection by finding
other-regarding love in the <i>Lysis</i>. Instead, she argues that theories
of other-regarding love are themselves problematic. Although this may seem
like burning down the village in order to save it, Obdrzalek makes serious
criticisms of two modern theories of other-regarding love. In this regard,
her contribution recalls Benson's.

Curtis Johnson suggests that we can solve the inconsistency of an
(apparently) liberal or disobedient <i>Apology</i> and an (apparently)
authoritarian <i>Crito</i> by interpreting <i>Apology</i> as more
authoritarian than it initially seems. (This is a minority view. Most
readers try to make <i>Crito</i> more liberal instead.) However, Johnson
also argues that, in addition to following the commands of human or divine
superiors, Socrates will follow the argument (<i>logos</i>) that seems best
to him on each occasion. I worry, however, that this opens up a huge
potential for conflict between what the state commands and what an agent
believes is the best argument. Johnson does not discuss how Socrates might
have balanced these demands in the face of such a conflict.

In his chapter on Socratic theology and piety, Mark McPherran offers an
attractive explanation of the religious views of Socrates. However,
McPherran's description has little in common with what Socrates says in
Plato's <i>Apology</i>. McPherran seems to be aware of this since he says
that Socrates is "obliged" by Meletus to focus on atheism (274 and see also
272). But it is Socrates who leads Meletus to atheism not the other way
around. As Myles Burnyeat and others have argued, Socrates seems to
avoid answering Meletus' actual charge of not believing in the city's
gods.

Using a four-part taxonomy of <i>mania</i> from Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i>,
John Bussanich categorizes and examines the various religious experiences
of Socrates. The chapter is necessarily highly speculative, and it wasn't
clear to me whether Bussanich intended his remarks to apply to Socrates the
person or the character of the same name in the writings of Plato and
Xenophon. This chapter, like McPartland's, Reshotko's and Obdrzalek's,
reminds us how unfamiliar or paradoxical Socrates can look to us now.

Rather than a purely political or purely religious motivation, Mark
Ralkowski argues that the trial and conviction of Socrates had mixed
motives. Socrates' anti-democratic statements might easily lead the city
and the jury to find him threatening, especially given the political
climate of 399 BCE. In addition, the religious <i>was</i> political to the
ancient Athenians. Socrates' private <i>daimonion</i> would have set him
apart from the rest of the city in a threatening manner. Thus, we don't
need to choose between political or religious interpretations of Socrates'
trial.

In sum, this is an excellent volume on Socratic philosophy for advanced
readers.

Errata

In the list of abbreviations on page vii, <i>R.</i> I is said to stand for
<i>Republic</i> Book I. Perhaps because of an over-eager search and
replace, however, numerous citations in the essays for <i>R.</i> I are
actually references to other books of Republic, not book I. In practice,
<i>R.</i> I confusingly means any book of the <i>Republic</i>. Incorrect
<i>R.</i> I citations can be found on pages 204, 269, 285, 294, 295, 316,
219, 311, 333 and 353.

The list of abbreviations on page viii gives <i>Symp.</i> for Plato's
<i>Symposium</i> and <i>Sym.</i> for Xenophon's, but in practice almost all
contributors use a third abbreviation (<i>Smp.</i>) for both works.

In Chapter 4 on page 81, the reference to "Prior 2014" should read "Prior
2004". In the same chapter on page 84, the sentence ending "which turns on
a theory of the way in which Forms are" should read "which turns on
a theory of the way in which Forms are separate."

In Chapter 5, the author frequently specifies what Greek verb Socrates uses
in a particular claim of ignorance or knowledge. This enables readers to
track whether Socrates uses specific verbs of cognition in different ways.
Verbs are generally cited as infinitives, but not consistently. This is
a problem for the Greekless reader who will take, for example, <i>oida</i>
and <i>eidenai</i> to be two distinct verbs. On page 108 in this chapter,
there is a formatting problem. In the left-hand column on the bottom of the
page, a paragraph from the author is formatted as the continuation of
a block quote from <i>Euthydemus</i>. Finally in the footnotes for this
chapter there is a reference on page 341 (footnote 14) to Nozick 1995, but
the bibliography has no entry for Nozick.  The missing reference is Robert
Nozick, "Socratic Puzzles", <i>Phronesis</i> (40), 2, 1995, 143-155.

In Chapter 8 on page 194, the authors switch very rapidly between "we" and
"they" when discussing an article that they wrote. One sentence begins "If
we are right about this", but the next starts "In this way, then on their
view..." In the same chapter, on page 198 in the block quote on the top
left, "philosophy bin general" should read "philosophy in general."

[[3]] This is my word rather than Reshotko's, but I think that it's fair.
Reshotko says more than once that Socrates views the knowledge essential to
<i>eudaimonia</i> to cover <i>everything</i>. As she puts it, "Socrates
thought all knowledge equally important and an equal factor in virtue so
that the completely and truly virtuous person is the one who has all of
every kind of knowledge" (158).

[[4]] Sophisticated readers may want to deny that it's possible to do one
without a healthy dose of the other, but I don't accept that it's
impossible for one to predominate. I would argue that the contrast between
Reshotko and Brickhouse and Smith is evidence that it is possible.
