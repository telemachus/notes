# Photius on Aenesidemus

Photius describes Aenesidemus’s *Pyrrhonian Logoi*, which was eight books long. According to Photius, the whole purpose of this work, which was dedicated to a Roman named Lucius Tubero, was to show that nothing was certain. Aenesidemus argued that neither Pyrrhonians nor others knew “the truth in things”, but that the Pyrrhonians had an advantage over other philosophers insofar as they didn’t falsely believe that they knew things. Photius gives an overview of the work, book by book.

## Book I

Photius devotes by far the most attention to Book I, which seems to have focused on two things. Aenesidemus laid out the differences between Academics and Pyrrhonians, and he gave a summary outline of Pyrrhonian arguments.

According to Aenesidemus, the Academics have become little more than “Stoics fighting Stoics”. They have taken on nearly everything from their Stoic rivals. The only battle that the Academics still have with the Stoics is over the kataleptic impression. If we are to believe Aenesidemus, the Academics have become Stoic in both style (they assert things dogmatically and confidently) and substance.

Pyrrhonians, according to Aenesidemus, are “aporetic and free of all δόγμα”. Photius provides a longish section where he demonstrates how careful the Pyrrhonians were. They don’t assert τὸ παράπαν that everything is incomprehensible or that it’s comprehensible. They limit themselves carefully to statements with οὐ μᾶλλον, and this part of the summary sounds very familar from Sextus.
