# *Anna Karenina* Leo Tolstoy (translated by Rosamund Bartlett)

## Part One

Stepan must "seek oblivion in the dream of life" and Dolly "drown[s] her sorrows
in [the day's chores] for a while" (6, 16).  There is a parallel but also
a strong contrast here.

See the long description of how Stepan's mind works (8-10) for a vivid picture
of an "unexamined life."

After Sergey Ivanovich and the professor from Kharkov discuss whether "there is
a boundary between psychological and physiological phenomena," we *see* this
boundary be breached in Levin (26).  As Levin goes down to find Kitty at the
skating rink, "the more he tried to calm down, the more breathless he became"
(30).  See also "He could tell she was there from the joy and fear gripping his
heart" and (slightly earlier) "An acquaintance he encountered called out to
him, but Levin did not even recognize who it was" (30).

Re blame, after Kitty rejects Levin, she feels "thrilled" (that he proposed to
her), and "she [keeps] telling herself...'It's not my fault.'"  Nevertheless,
"an inner voice [tells] her otherwise" (57).  Kitty, unlike Anna much later,
does not deny her own guilt.  She responds to this inner voice by praying "Lord
have mercy" over and over before falling asleep (57).  Cf. also Levin who prays
in a similar way when Kitty is in labor.  (TODO: find the page reference for
this.)

When Stepan tells Anna that they hope that Vronsky will marry Kitty, Anna reacts
in a manner that suggests a lot.

> "Really?" said Anna quietly.  "Well, let's talk about you now," she added,
> shaking her head as if she wanted physically to banish something extraneous
> that was bothering her.  "Let's talk about your affairs.  I received your
> letter, and here I am" (68).

Anna treats Dolly kindly and sympathetically.  But at the same time we notice
that Anna is strategic and even cunning when she speaks with Dolly.  For
example, "What touched me most (and here Anna guessed what could touch Dolly the
most)..." (71).  See also these scenes, from later in Part One.

>   After dinner, when Dolly left to go to her room, Anna quickly stood up and
> went over to her brother, who was lighting a cigar.
>   "Stiva," she said to him with a merry wink, making the sign of the cross
> over him and indicating the door with her eyes, "Off you go, and may God
> help you" (74).

> (Kitty) "How can *you* be bored at a ball?"
> "Why should I not be bored at a ball?" asked Anna.
> Kitty noticed that Anna knew what answer would follow.
> "Because you are always the best person there."
> Anna had a capacity for blushing.  She blushed and... (75).

Re forgiveness, see the following.

> (Dolly) "Yes, but would you forgive?"
> (Anna) "I don't know, I cannot judge...No, actually I can," said Anna upon
> reflection; and after pondering the situation and weighing it up in her mind,
> she added: "No, I can, I definitely can. Yes, I would forgive.  It is true
> I would not be the same, but I would forgive, and would forgive as if it had
> never happened, as if it had never ever happened."
> "Well, of course," interrupted Dolly quickly, as if she was saying something
> she had often thought herself, "otherwise it would not be forgiveness.  If you
> forgive, you have to forgive completely.  Well, let us go, I'll show you to
> your room," she said, getting up, and on the way there Dolly embraced Anna.
> "I'm so glad that you have come, my dear, I really am.  I feel better, so much
> better" (73).

When Levin returns home, he wants to better.  Tolstoy comments on this as
follows.

> The study was slowly lit up by the candle that was brought in.  Familiar
> details emerged: deer antlers, bookshelves, the shiny stove with the vent that
> had long been in need of repair, his father’s sofa, the big desk, an open book
> on the desk, a broken ashtray, a notebook with his handwriting.  When he saw
> all this, he surrendered to a moment of doubt about whether he could create
> that new life he had been dreaming about during his journey home.  It was as
> if all these traces of his life had grabbed hold of him and were saying: "No,
> you’ll never get away from us or be any different, but you’ll be just the same
> as you have always been: with your doubts and eternal dissatisfaction with
> yourself, your vain attempts to improve and your failures, and your eternal
> expectation of a happiness which can never possibly be granted to you."
> 
> But that was just his possessions talking, while another voice in his heart
> was saying that he should not give in to the past, and could make whatever he
> wished of himself.  And heeding this voice, he went over to the corner where
> he had two heavy dumb-bells, and started doing lifting exercises, trying to
> instil some vigour into himself.  Footsteps creaked outside the door.  He
> hurriedly put down the dumb-bells (95).

Re guilt and blame, see the following conversation between Anna and Dolly.

> 'Everyone has skeletons in their soul, as the English say.'
>
> 'What skeletons do you have?  Everything is so clear with you.'
>
> 'Oh, I have them!'  Anna said suddenly, and unexpectedly after her tears,
> a sly, humorous smile wrinkled her lips.
>
> 'So your skeletons are funny, not grim,' said Dolly, smiling.
>
> 'No, they are grim.  Do you know why I am going today and not tomorrow?  It's
> a confession which has been weighing on me, and I want to make it to you,'
> said Anna, leaning back decisively into her armchair and looking straight into
> Dolly's eyes.
>
> And to her amazement Dolly saw that Anna had blushed to her ears, to the curly
> black ringlets of hair on her neck.
>
> 'Yes,' continued Anna.  'Do you know why Kitty did not come to dinner?  She is
> jealous of me.  I have spoiled...I was the reason why that ball was a torment
> rather than a joy for her.  But it's not my fault, it really isn't, or maybe
> just slightly,' she said, drawing out the word 'slightly' in a high-pitched
> voice.
>
> 'Oh, you sounded just like Stiva when you said that!' said Dolly, laughing.
>
> Anna was offended.
>
> 'Oh, no, no! I am not like Stiva,' she said, frowning.  'That is why I am
> telling you this, because I will not allow myself even for a moment to doubt
> myself,' said Anna.
>
> But the moment she uttered those words, she felt they were untrue; she not
> only did doubt herself, but the thought of Vronsky gave her a thrill, and she
> was leaving earlier than she had wanted purely to avoid meeting him again
> (100-101).

Again on guilt, see the following.

> The hero of the novel had already begun to attain his English fortune,
> a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was experiencing a desire to go with him
> to this estate, when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed and that
> she was ashamed for the same reason.  But what should he be ashamed of?  'And
> what exactly am I ashamed of?' she asked herself in aggrieved surprise.  She
> put down her book and leaned back in her seat, gripping the paper-knife
> tightly in both hands.  There had been nothing shameful.  She sifted through
> all her Moscow memories.  They were all good, all pleasant.  She remembered
> the ball, she remembered Vronsky and his love-stricken, submissive face, and
> she remembered all her interactions with him; there had been nothing shameful.
> But it was also at this particular stage in her recollections that her feeling
> of shame increased, as if some kind of inner voice was saying to her right at
> the moment when she remembered Vronsky: 'Warm, very warm, hot.'  'Well, then?'
> she said to herself resolutely as she shuffled in her seat. 'What can it mean?
> Am I really afraid to look at this directly?  Well, then?  Can there really
> be, and could there ever be any kind of relations between me and that officer
> boy which might be different to those with every other acquaintance?'  She
> smiled contemptuously and picked up her book again, but now she definitely
> could not understand what she was reading.  She ran her paper-knife over the
> window, then pressed its smooth and cold surface against her cheek, and almost
> laughed out loud from the joy suddenly overcoming her for no apparent reason.
> She felt that her nerves were being stretched ever more tautly, like strings
> on some kind of twisting pegs.  She felt her eyes opening wider and wider, her
> fingers and toes twitching nervously, something in her chest constricting her
> breathing, and every image and sound in this flickering half-light striking
> her with exceptional sharpness.  She kept being visited by moments of doubt as
> to whether the carriage was moving forwards, or backwards, or standing
> stock-still.  Was that Annushka beside her or a stranger?  'Over there on the
> armrest, is that a fur coat or an animal?  And what am I doing here?  Is this me
> or someone else?'  She was afraid of surrendering to this oblivion.  But
> something was luring her into it, and she could surrender to it or resist it
> at will.  In order to try and come to her senses, she stood up, threw aside her
> rug, and removed the cape from her warm dress.  For a moment she did come to
> her senses, and realized that the emaciated peasant in the long nankeen coat
> with a missing button who had come in was the stoker, that he was looking at
> the thermometer, and that the wind and the snow had burst in through the door
> after him, but then everything became confused again…The long-waisted peasant
> started gnawing at something in the wall, the old lady started stretching her
> legs out the whole length of the carriage, filling it with a black cloud; then
> there was a terrible screeching and banging sound, as if someone were being
> torn to pieces; then there was a blinding red light, and then everything was
> shut out by a wall.   Anna felt she had vanished.  But all this was enjoyable,
> not frightening.  The voice of the muffled, snow-covered man shouted out
> something above her ear.  She stood up and collected herself; she realized
> they had arrived at a station, and that this was the conductor.  She asked
> Annushka to hand her back the cape she had taken off, and her scarf, put them
> on, and headed for the door (102-103).

Re guilt and emotional upheaval, see the following.

> She had told herself more than once these last days and just now, that to her
> Vronsky was simply one of the hundreds of endlessly indistinguishable young
> men who were to be encountered everywhere, and that she would never allow
> herself even to think about him; but now, from the first moment she set eyes
> on him, she was overcome with a feeling of jubilant pride.  She did not need
> to ask why he was there.  She knew, just as surely as if he had told her, that
> he was there to be where she was.
>
> 'I didn't know you were travelling.  Why are you travelling?' she asked,
> lowering the hand which had been about to take hold of the post.  Her face
> radiated irrepressible joy and excitement.
>
> 'Why am I travelling?' he replied, looking straight into her eyes.  'You know
> that I am travelling to be where you are,' he said.  'I can't do otherwise.”
> “And right at that moment, as if it had overcome some obstacle, the wind
> hurled down snow from the roof of the carriage and rattled a loose sheet of
> iron, while up in front, the locomotive's low whistle started to wail
> mournfully and gloomily.  The full horror of the snowstorm seemed even more
> splendid to her now.  He had said precisely what her soul desired, but which
> she feared with her reason.  She did not answer, and he saw a struggle in her
> face.
>
> 'Forgive me if what I said displeased you,' he said meekly.
>
> He spoke courteously and respectfully, but so firmly and insistently that for
> a long time she could not say anything in reply.
>
> 'What you are saying is wrong, and I must ask you, if you are a good man, to
> forget what you have said, as I will,' she said finally.
>
> 'I will never ever forget a single word or gesture of yours, nor can I...
> (105).

This passage continues as follows.

> [S]he paused in this small vestibule while she went over in her mind what had
> happened.  Without being able to remember what either of them had said, she
> understood through her feelings that this brief exchange had brought them
> terribly close; and she was both frightened and overjoyed by this.  After
> standing there for a few seconds, she went into the compartment and sat down
> in her seat.  That magical, tense state which had tormented her before had not
> only returned but had intensified, and had reached the point where she feared
> something too taut inside her might snap at any moment.  She did not sleep all
> night.  But there was nothing unpleasant or gloomy in the tension or the
> dreams which filled her imagination; on the contrary, there was something
> joyous, searing, and exciting (105).

After Anna returns home with her husband, she continues to feel ashamed of her
behavior and Vronsky's.  (Vronsky goes out of his way to speak to Anna on the
train platform in St. Petersburg, in front of her husband.)

> The feeling of groundless shame she had experienced during the journey, as
> well as the anxiety, had completely disappeared.  Back in her usual routine,
> she once more felt steadfast and beyond reproach.
>
> She recalled her state of mind the previous day with amazement.  'What exactly
> happened?  Nothing.  Vronsky said something foolish, which was easy to put
> a stop to, and I answered as I should have done.  There is no need to tell my
> husband, nor should I.  Talking about it would mean attaching importance to
> something which has none.'  She remembered recounting to her husband how one
> of his subordinates in Petersburg had once almost made a confession of love to
> her, and how Alexey Alexandrovich had replied that every woman in society was
> liable to encounter this sort of thing, but that he had complete faith in her
> discretion, and would never allow himself to demean either of them by being
> jealous.  'So there's no reason to tell him?  No, and thank goodness there is
> nothing to tell anyway,' she said to herself (111).

Anna explodes in anger at a dressmaker, and she feels ashamed at her own
outburst.

> Having occupied herself with her wardrobe after the guests had left, Anna had
> in fact become very angry.  Generally expert in dressing inexpensively, before
> leaving for Moscow she had given three dresses to the seamstress for altering.
> The dresses needed to be altered in such a way that they would not be
> recognized, and were supposed to have been ready three days earlier.  It
> turned out that two dresses were nowhere near finished, while the third had
> been altered, but not in the way Anna wanted.  The seamstress came to explain,
> maintaining it would be better that way, and Anna flew into such a rage that
> she was ashamed to recall it later on.  In order to calm down completely, she
> went into the nursery and spent the whole evening with her son; she put him to
> bed herself, made the sign of the cross over him, and covered him up with his
> blanket (112).

Karenin reveals his unforgiving side when Anna talks with him about Stepan and
Dolly.

> [Anna] told him about her feelings of pity, first for her brother, and then
> for Dolly.
>
> 'I do not believe a person like that can be excused, even if he is your
> brother,' said Alexey Alexandrovich sternly.
>
> Anna smiled.  She realized that he had said that precisely to show that family
> considerations could not prevent him from expressing his sincere opinion.  She
> knew this quality of her husband's, and she liked it (113)
