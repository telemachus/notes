Errata

In the list of abbreviations on page vii, <i>R.</i> I is said to stand for
<i>Republic</i> Book I. Perhaps because of an over-eager search and
replace, however, numerous citations in the essays for <i>R.</i> I are
actually references to other books of Republic, not book I. In practice,
<i>R.</i> I confusingly means any book of the <i>Republic</i>. Incorrect
<i>R.</i> I citations can be found on pages 204, 269, 285, 294, 295, 316,
219, 311, 333 and 353.

The list of abbreviations on page viii gives <i>Symp.</i> for Plato's
<i>Symposium</i> and <i>Sym.</i> for Xenophon's, but in practice almost all
contributors use a third abbreviation (<i>Smp.</i>) for both works.

In Chapter 4 on page 81, the reference to "Prior 2014" should read "Prior
2004". In the same chapter on page 84, the sentence ending "which turns on
a theory of the way in which Forms are" should read "which turns on
a theory of the way in which Forms are separate."

In Chapter 5, the author frequently specifies what Greek verb Socrates uses
in a particular claim of ignorance or knowledge. This enables readers to
track whether Socrates uses specific verbs of cognition in different ways.
Verbs are generally cited as infinitives, but not consistently. This is
a problem for the Greekless reader who will take, for example, <i>oida</i>
and <i>eidenai</i> to be two distinct verbs. On page 108 in this chapter,
there is a formatting problem. In the left-hand column on the bottom of the
page, a paragraph from the author is formatted as the continuation of
a block quote from <i>Euthydemus</i>. Finally in the footnotes for this
chapter there is a reference on page 341 (footnote 14) to Nozick 1995, but
the bibliography has no entry for Nozick.  The missing reference is Robert
Nozick, "Socratic Puzzles", <i>Phronesis</i> (40), 2, 1995, 143-155.

In Chapter 8 on page 194, the authors switch very rapidly between "we" and
"they" when discussing an article that they wrote. One sentence begins "If
we are right about this", but the next starts "In this way, then on their
view..." In the same chapter, on page 198 in the block quote on the top
left, "philosophy bin general" should read "philosophy in general."
