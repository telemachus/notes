# *The Texts of Early Greek Philosophy* Daniel W. Graham (CUP, 2010)

## A note on text references

Graham gives each philosopher a three-letter abbreviation. For example, Anaximander is Axr. He sequentially numbers every text for each philosopher, and a quotation or near-quotation gets a fragment number as well. For example, the first fragment of Anaximander is Axr9[F1]; i.e., the ninth text and the first fragment.

Diels-Kranz use a different system, and it won't necessarily match Graham's. First, Diels-Kranz number each author. For example, Anaximander is 12. Second, they divide their material into A and B texts; A texts are testimony, and B texts are fragments or near-quotations. They number the A and B series, and those numbers won't necessarily line up with Graham's numbers. Graham includes the Diels-Kranz series and numbers for the material he gives in Greek. There is also a concordance in the back of the book.

## Preface

We needed a new edition of the Presocratics. Diels-Kranz was last updated in 1952, they only translate fragments (not testimony), they translate in German, and their principles for what authors to include or exclude are debatable. In addition Graham intends this book to have a slightly different audience that Diels-Kranz. He wants it to provide "a bridge between the introductory textbook and the exhaustive collection" (xiii).

## Introduction

For Graham, the Presocratics "introduced a new kind of wisdom to the world" (1). Starting "suddenly" in the sixth century BCE, they attempt "to explain, not just this or that fact or custom or institution, but everything at once" (1). The work they did led both to philosophy and to science, and the Presocratics engage in both fields, from our point of view.

### 1. Who they were

The ancients locate the start of the movement in Miletus, a "cosmopolitan port city" near the west coast of modern Turkey. Miletus had several colonies and traded throughout the Mediterranean; they also had "contact with the great civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia" (1).

The canonical first three Presocratics are Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. They were all broadly naturalist thinkinkers. That is, they tried to explain how the world worked by means of discussion of the interaction of everyday substances like water and air. They did not use (for the most part?) explanations relying on magic or supernatural forces. (Graham briefly compares these naturalist explanations with those found in Homer's epics.) The Presocratics are philosophical and scientific insofar as they use "observation and inference alone, independent of tradition or revelation" to explain the world (2).

Nevertheless, Graham also argues that the Presocratics followed tradition in several important ways. Several Presocratics offer accounts of how the world came to be, and these accounts have important similarities with Hesiod's mythical account. In addition, most Presocratics imagine the world as a flat disk with heaven above—and some include an underworld below.

Graham describes in very broad terms the changes between sixth- and fourth-century Presocratics. In the fifth century, new thinkiers offered a "sustained critique of cosmology itself" as well as "a more logical and metaphysical way of thinking in place of an almost exclusive concern for nauralistic accounts and physical models" (3). The theory of atomism arises in this period, and eventually it will beat all rivals and takes its place as an established scientific theory. The end of the fifth century also saw the development of "relativistic and humanistic approaches to experience" (3). Finally, in the fourth century, Socratic philosophy introduces a more "personal approach to moral self-knowledge" and a "contempt for abstract speculation" (3). This pushes aside much of earlier Presocratic thought, although "many of the advances of early philosophy were incorporated into Socratic philosophy" (3).

### 2. Schools and movements

Graham is more impressed by the diversity than the unity of Presocratic thinkers. He believes that they fall into schools far less than, say, Hellenistic philosophers do. And he argues that the schools described by later thinkers (both ancient and modern) are "anachronistic" for the Presocratic period (3). After all, "there were no formal institutions of learning, but at best only informal associations between a master and his students" (3). He also briefly mentions "several competing ways of grouping the Presocratics" (3):

+ eastern Ionian versus westerners (roughly, scientific versus mythical)
+ natural philosophers versus opponents of natural philosophy
+ monists versus pluralists
+ the "schools" of Ionians, Pythagoreans, Eleatics, atomists, etc.

Although Graham admits that each of these groupings has *something* to say for it, he finds all of them too superficial.

As a result, Graham avoids many traditional groupings, though he makes some "minimal concessions" in other cases (4). He puts Zeno after Parmenides, and he groups Leucippus and Democritus together, for example. He also groups the cosmologists and their opponents together and the sophists separately. Graham himself cares more about Parmenides as "the watershed figure in early Greek philosophy." He believes that we can meaningfully divide Presocratic thinkers into pre-Parmenides and post-Parmenides.

Graham sketches four broad phases for early Greek philosophy:

1. The earliest thinkers tried to explain the universe "in a quasi-scientific way" (4).
1. Next came a reaction from the Eleatics. They were anti-cosmological and challenged our ability to explain change at all; they favored "a kind of metaphysical analysis" of things instead of the earlier sort-of-science.
1. In reaction, a new wave of cosmologists react to Eleatic criticisms and try again to explain the universe and change.
1. Finally, the sophists primarily address human life and education rather than attempting to discuss or explain the universe as a whole. That said, some sophists also had a sideline in cosmology.

Graham also reminds us that the earliest thinkers had no single standard name. The term "philosopher" comes later, and the Presocratics didn't seem to have any specific term that they used for themselves and their fellow thinkers.

He also notes that the exact chronology of these thinkers isn't always clear.

### 3. Texts and contexts

Graham offers a rapid overview of how we get from Presocratic writings—which were largely lost very early—to our current reconstruction of their views. He also discusses in general terms the trasmission of texts from antiquity to the modern age.

In terms of presentation, Graham keeps fragments and testimony together. He doesn't follow the Diels-Kranz method of a series of testimony (A texts) followed by fragments (B texts) extracted from that same testimony, for the most part. Instead, everything appears together, but the fragments are in bold font, to help signal their importance.

### 4. Sources for the Presocratics

#### 4.1 Philosophers

They have their own agendas.

#### 4.2 Doxographers

They give us views (at best), generally without surrounding context or supporting arguments. Since most authors relied exclusively on earlier doxographers, "the information steadily deteriorated over time" (9).

#### 4.3 Biographers

Aristoxenus, a student of Aristotle, started the fashion of writing biographies of philosophers. There was information to be had on Plato and Aristotle, but nothing very reliable about the Presocratics already in antiquity. Biography would also poach from doxography. A major surviving source is Diogenes Laertius from the early third century CE. Graham describes him as "more of a cut-and-paste hack than a scholar" (9).

#### 4.4 Other sources

Various other writers "sometimes provide information about the Presocratics" (9). Graham mentions Herodotus, Isocrates, Plutarch, and the Aristotelian commentators. He singles out Simplicius, "who quotes extensively from rare books of several Presocratics" (9). According to Graham, educated people would know about as much as a doxographer, but only rare individuals knew anything deeper or more useful.

### 5. Historiography

#### 5.1 Antiquity

The ancients were not critical historians of philosophy. They used previous philosophers for their own purposes, they only saw what *they themseves* cared about, and they tended to simplify and pigeon-hole earlier thinkers.

#### 5.2 The Middle Ages and Renaissance

Potted history of Middle Ages and Renaissance: in a nutshell, renewed demand for Aristotle in the twelfth century, Diogenes Laertius translated into Latin in the same century but then lost again for a while, complete editions of Anaxagoras and Empedocles still available in Greece (?!?) but later lost, the Renaissance, Greeks fleeing the Ottoman Turks head for Italy with manuscripts, new editions of Plato, Aristotle, and others, Diogenes Laertius published in Basle in 1533, philosophers of the time are either Platonists (with a Neoplatonic spin) or Aristotelians (with a scholastic spin).

#### 5.3 The modern period

Not much useful for history of philosophy in the seventeenth or eighteenth century. History comes alive in the nineteenth century. Also Hegel and then Zeller (1844-1852). In the twentieth century, Cherniss and others see through Aristotle and also notice the importance of Parmenides in a new way.

### 6. The texts

Graham explains some of his choices. No Hippias, Critias, or Archelaus because there aren't enough fragments for them. No Archytas or Nausiphanes because they're too late.

## Part I: Cosmologists and ontologists

### A. The sixth century BC

#### 1. Thales

##### Notes on Graham

The ancients considered Thales the first philosopher, but he doesn't seem to have left behind any writings. He is more of a legendary than historical figure in many ways. Thales was also the only philosopher and scientist among the Seven Sages.

He is supposed to have spent time in Egypt, and Graham finds this "quite plausible" because Miletus had a colony (Naucratis) in the Nile delta (17). In any case, there are stories that Thales offered a naturalistic explanation of the Nile's annual flooding. Graham accepts the stories, which he finds credible and completely in line with Greek, Presocratic attempts to explain natural phenomena in natural terms.

Thales is also famous for predicting an eclipse on May 28, 585 BCE. Graham believes (like most moderns?) that Thales "must have done it on the basis of Babylonian tables" and that Thales himself may have had little or no understanding of "the causes of eclipses" (18). Graham adds that the successors of Thales in Miletus talked about the causes of eclipses, but they were clearly confused about how they actually work.

Finally, Thales is best known for "advancing a unified theory to account for the world...from water" (18). Thales should be seen as the first to propose a single basic thing (ἀρχή) to explain the entire world. However, Graham doubts that Thales himself actually provided a full theory to explain *how* water led to everything else.

##### My observations

If we consider Thales's theory that everything is somewhat water, we have a clear case of a scientific image clashing with the manifest image, right at the start of ancient Greek philosophy. The world certainly does not appear to be all or only water. Nor is it at all obvious how, say, a mountain or a human body or an animal's fur could be *really* or *originally* water. Inasmuch as he claims otherwise, Thales opens up (for the first time?) a gap between appearance and reality in Greek philosophy.

Note that Aristotle and Hippias attribute to him the belief that inanimate things have "some soul" on the basis of the magnet and amber (text 1, §24). This suggests soul as a force of motion or explanation (or both), but does that belief come from Thales or the later philosophers? We can believe it of Thales himself if we can take §27 seriously: ἀρχὴν δὲ τῶν πάντων ὕδωρ ὑπεστήσατο, καὶ *τὸν κόσμον ἔμψυχον* καὶ δαιμόνων πλήρη.

Aristotle explicitly considers Thales "the originator of this kind of theory" (§15). By which he means a theory according to which the principle, or principles, of everything is matter. Aristotle explains the appeal of such theories by saying that (it appears?) that all existing things consist of matter, and that things come to be first from matter and are destroyed into matter. Thus, this persisting thing—the matter—appears to be primary.Thales is also said to have considered this same basic thing, water, to be the end (τέλος) of everything. Presumably, Thales was first to do this as well, though maybe that's a simplification.

I wonder about a potential conflict at the heart of Thales's theory. According to several later philosophers, Thales bases his view that water is primary on everyday observations. For example, dead bodies wither and dry out, animals and plants feed off of water, the seed of (some? many?) animals is wet. If we combine this with an axiom that, the origin of each thing is also what will nourish it (§17), then water is primary. But how can we rely on (some) sensory observations given that others are so misleading. That is, why don't these other observations, for example that fire has nothing in common with water, count against the theory as much as the favored observations? Shorter: how do we pick which observations to care about without begging the question?

#### 2. Anaximander

##### Notes on Graham

Modern scholars tend to pick Anaximander rather than Thales as the first real philosopher. First, he wrote a book while Thales did not. Second, in this book, we can see the beginnings of what became philosophy and science. He offers both a cosmogony—an account of the origin of everything—and a cosmology—an account of how the world currently works. Unlike Hesiod, his origin story is based on physical things and naturalistic explanations rather than gods and supernatural powers. His work was in prose, and this too set a precedent and distinguished him from his poetic predecessors.

#### My observations

Anaximander considers the ἀρχή to be τὸ ἄπειρον, or "the unlimited" or "the boundless". As the name suggests, Anaximander does not give a positive characterization of this: "the parts change, but the totality is changeless" (§1) is about as much as we get. Anaximander is also credited with important astrological discoveries or innoations (the gnomon; theories about the moon, stars, earth, and sun; the gnomon; as well as mathematical advances. Many (?) ancients considered Anaximander the first Greek to write about nature in prose.

Anaximander considers τὸ ἄπειρον to be both the γένεσις and the φθορά of everything. (Cf. Thales on water as ἀρχή and τέλος of everything.) He describes the birth and death of things in "a rather poetic manner" (§9) according to Theophrastus (via Simplicius). I'd add that the terms are more normative than descriptive: there is talk of "paying the penalty for injustice" and things happening "in accordance with obligation." Hippolytus attributes to Anaximander a belief that "motion is everlasting" (§10).

If Aristotle can be trusted, then Anaximander argues from very abstract principles towards the conclusion that the source of everything itself must be without beginning and without end, as well as unlimited and without boundary (§16), but this text seems to be as much (or more) Aristotle than anyone else.

Anaximander boldy argued that nothing except equilibrium keeps the earth where it is (§20). As Aristotle puts it, earth remains διὰ ὁμοιότητα: "it is no more fitting for what occupies the middle and is equally situated in relation to the extremes to travel up than down or to the side; and it is impossible for it to make a move in contrary directions at the same time, so it stays in place by necessity" (§21).

#### 3. Anaximenes

##### Notes on Graham

Scholars often dismiss the importance of Anaximenes, the last Milesian, but Graham disagrees. He argues that Anaximenes offers a far more robust attempt at a scientific explanation than Anaximander. Whereas Anaximander uses τὸ ἄπειρον in a hand-wavey, catch-all manner, Anaximenes attempts to provide a single mechanism (increase in density of a single stuff, namely air) to explain things. Apparently many people consider Anaximenes the inventor of material monism. Graham adds that his theories had a great deal of influence on Heraclitus and Parmenides: it was explanations like those of Anaximenes that the two later Presocratics were attacking.

##### My observations

If we follow accounts such as Plato in his *Timaeus* (§10, §39), then Anaximenes is the *true* inventor of material monism because he didn't just vaguely say that one thing is the beginning (and end) of everything. What makes Anaximenes a true material monist is that he gives a quasi-scientific theory of how *one thing* becomes other things, I suppose.

#### 4. Xenophanes

##### Notes on Graham

Xenophanes sometimes offers conventional-sounding piety, but his deeper views clearly clash with traditional religion. He rejects the "impious" stories from Homer and Hesiod, as Plato and others will do, and he argues for a kind of purified, rational religion—maybe even a monotheistic one.

However skepticial Xenophanes may have been, he also argues that his wisdom has more value for the city than an Olympic victor does. Graham notes that athletic competitions generally "took place at religious festivals" (130), and thus Xenophanes may criticize Olympic victors as part of his overall critique of religion. (I doubt this. It seems too pointedly about value, and Xenophanes never explicitly makes the connection that Graham mentions.)

Xenophanes gives "an early testimony of Pythagoras" (130). We see here an early Greek view of the doctrine of reincarnation.

Xenophanes criticizes religion for being immoral and irrational. It's immoral insofar as the gods are "all-too-human" (131); the evidence here comes from Homer and Hesiod. (NB: Hesiod is on the whole no better than Homer according to Xenophanes.) It's irrational since Xenophanes offers arguments that push towards monotheism—or at least towards some kind of rationalized all-powerful, all-good god.

Later Greek tradition viewed Xenophanes as the first Eleatic (and sometimes teacher of Parmenides). We see this view in Plato and Aristotle, but they didn't create it, according to Graham. They inherited it from "an earlier sophistic classification" (131). Theophrastus picks up this view and magnifies it, after which it is everywhere in the doxographic writers.

The doxographers disagree: is Xenophanes a material monist (with earth as his one substance) or a dualist (with earth and water as the two elements)? Graham notes that Aristotle claims that "no one made earth the principle of all things," but some evidence suggests that Xenophanes did just that (131).

Xenophanes portrays the earth as extending downwards forever with air above extending upwards forever, unlike other Presocratics who imagine the earth suspended or on top of something else.

Xenophanes made use of empirical evidence (or stories about empirical evidence?) in some cases. For example, he made certain arguments based on fossil found high up. He also had a theory about the sun forming everyday from smaller flare fires that is based on (or is calibrated with?) observations from Mt. Ida.

Xenophanes offers rationalizing interpretations of the rainbow and St. Elmo's fire.

Graham thinks that most interpretations of Xenophanes's epistemology are too sophisticated. Instead, Graham views Xenophanes as "in some sense a fallibilist who seems to believe that progress is possible despite the absence of certainty" (133). Graham mostly tries to avoid attributing to Xenophanes anything too sophisticated or deep, as far as a theory of knowledge goes.

That said, fragment 38 hints at Socratic-Platonic ideas that only god posesses certain knowledge. Humans inevitably have to settle for something less that certain knowledge.
