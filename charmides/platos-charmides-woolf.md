# Notes on *Plato's Charmides*, Raphael Woolf

## Chapter 1: Introduction: Content, Methodology, Structure

### Methodological Principles

Woolf says that he will follow two methodological principles.

Principle of Agnosticism
: One should not assume, in advance of reading the *Charmides*, that one has
  knowledge of the aims and methods at work therein of either Plato or his
  main character Socrates (5).

Principle of Separation
: [W]e should not assume that what is said or done by any of Plato's
  characters is necessarily endorsed by Plato himself, or identifiable with
  Plato's own views or motivations (11).

Woolf acknowledges several limits and qualifications to the principle of
agnosticism.  First, the principle is (as he puts it) methodological rather
than absolute (or literal).  Woolf himself (and presumably almost all of his
readers) *have* read other dialogues by Plato.  And Woolf acknowledges that we
all must (consciously or unconsciously) read in the light of our existing
knowledge and beliefs about Plato and Socrates.  Second, because *Charmides*
focuses on fictionalized (rather than fictional) characters, Woolf says that
"we are expected to have in mind at least some basic features of their
historical counterparts' lives" (10).[^1]  Finally, Woolf says that he will
not "wear a hair shirt" and that he will "occasionally" refer to other works
by Plato (6).

Woolf uses the principle of separation primarily to tell us that we should not
assume "that Socrates must be Plato's hero" and that we should not "assume
uncritical endorsement by the author Plato of the character Socrates" (12,
13).

Woolf qualifies the principle of separation as he qualifies the principle of
agnosticism.  We may conclude by "identifying the views of a character in
a Platonic work with those of Plato himself," but we should not start from
there.  Woolf says that this means that the principle of separation is
methodological.

Woolf also stresses that Plato and Socrates go about their business
differently: Socrates talks with people, but Plato (the author) writes.  Woolf
promises to make more of this distinction later in the book.

Finally, Woolf argues that we need to take the principle of separation extra
seriously for *Charmides* because Socrates narrates the work.  Thus, as Woolf
puts it, "*Charmides* offers an overtly *perspectival* take on the events it
purports to depict" (14).  Woolf continues:

> This means, from a formal point of view, that we do not simply have here
> separation mandated by the fact of an author depicting the sayings and
> doings of certain characters.  We have, in addition, rather than a formally
> neutral 'X says, Y says...' pattern, a first-person narrative take on
> proceedings that are thereby presented as being from one particular
> viewpoint.  This feature alerts us to the idea that the viewpoint we are
> given may be open to challenge from other viewpoints and in this regard does
> not necessarily represent one that the author endorses, or expects the
> reader to endorse, uncritically (15).

### Structure of *Charmides*

Woolf distinguishes the vertical from the horizontal structure of *Charmides*.
By "horizontal structure," Woolf means "the sequence of conversations and
events that the work portrays" (16).  By "vertical structure," Woolf means how
"the [horizontal] sequence of conversations and events is embedded within
a series of compositional levels" (16).

Woolf distinguishes three vertical layers.  At the topmost level, Plato
composes the entire work.  At the next level down, Socrates narrates events
and conversations to an unnamed listener.  At the lowest level, Socrates
returns from military service, goes to a palaestra, and talks with a group of
people.

Woolf argues that the extra vertical layer (Socrates narrating to an
unspeaking listener) "meshes naturally with the principle of separation" and
that it "allow[s] for critical distance between Plato the author and Socrates
the character" (17).  In this context, Woolf introduces one of his key claims
about *Charmides*: "a difference in viewpiont between Socrates and Plato"
(17).  According to Woolf, in this dialogue, Socrates is driven by erotic
desire: "his goal is to discover (or instil) beauty" (17).  Plato, however,
aims to "instil in his readers...the stance of enquiry" (18).  Woolf
characterizes the stance of enquiry as "an attitude that does not take ideas
or arguments on trust but engages reflectively and critically with them" (18).
Thus, as Woolf puts it, we find a significant difference between Socratic and
Platonic enquiry.  Socrates enquires because he pursues beauty; the search for
truth is less important than the search for beauty.  If Woolf is right, then
Plato implicitly criticizes such enquiry.  Instead, we should enquire
primarily in order to discover the truth.

Woolf uses vertical structure to explain a problem with interpretations based
only on horizontal structure.  According to many interpreters, the real work
of *Charmides* only begins at 164 or so.  If this is right, then roughly half
the work is preliminary to the real work of the dialogue.  Woolf objects, "Why
does it take Plato around half the work to get going?" (20).  Woolf also notes
that this same puzzle encourages us to remember the principle of agnosticism.
If we assume from other works that Socrates cares most about definitions, then
we may assume that the important part of *Charmides* only begins when Socrates
searches for definitions.  Woolf rejects this attitude; he seeks an
interpretation that makes sense of the whole dialogue.

NOTE to self: I find much of what Woolf says here oversubtle or simply
unlikely.  For example, Woolf argues "In noting the display of the work's
vertical structure via its depiction of the anonymous companion's silent
engagement with Socrates' central discussion with Critias, we are thus invited
to reflect upon what our own engagement with the written work should be" (29).
I simply don't buy this.  Moreover, Woolf has read Finkelberg on Platonic
narrative, but he doesn't seem to acknowledge that Finkelberg denies any such
critical use of vertical structure.

## Chapter 2: The Stance of Enquiry: Five Examples

> *Charmides* thus ostensibly presents a particular narrative structure,
> namely that of the character Socrates.  We are given a series of events and
> conversations as experienced and described by him.  By constructing the work
> as perspectival in this fashion, Plato invites us to notice that feature
> and, as I have argued, to maintain as a result a certain critical stance
> towards Socrates' perspective — in the first instance just because it is
> simply one perspective among (potentially) many (31).

Woolf goes on to argue that we cannot assume that Plato privileges the outlook
of Socrates "normatively" simply because Socrates is the first-person narrator
or the protagonist of many of Plato's dialogues.  Woolf insists that we must
distinguish the formal from the normative privilege that Plato grants to
Socrates.

> So we should not, in noticing that Plato has Socrates in the role of
> narrator and has him play, moreover, a leading role within that narration,
> jump to the conclusion that we are to regard Socrates as the good guy, the
> enlightened one, or the hero (31-32).

Nevertheless, Woolf immediately continues, "That may of course be Plato's
ultimate intent.  But we cannot simply read that off from the formal role that
Plato assigns to him" (32).

In addition, Woolf argues that we cannot reach the conclusion that Plato
normatively privileges Socrates by saying that Socrates is a recurrent leading
character.  In a dispute with Irwin, Woolf claims that it does not matter that
Socrates is a recurrent protagonist *and* that his views are consistent.
Strictly speaking, we cannot get normative privilege from repetition and
coherence, says Woolf.

However, Woolf ignores a key part of Irwin's argument, namely that most
readers in antiquity took Plato to normatively privilege Socrates.  If
Aristotle reads Plato this way, then we may wish to follow since presumably
Aristotle was in a much better position to know what Plato had in mind than we
are, suggests Irwin.

Later in this chapter, Woolf focuses on the selectivity of Socrates's
narration of his visit to the palaestra.  In particular, Woolf repeatedly
notes that Socrates does not narrate in any detail the discussion about the
battle at Potidaea (39, 40).  I'm unsure what to make of this.  Mostly, I want
to reply that this is a matter of what *Plato* chooses to focus on rather than
anything like a characterization of Socrates.

Woolf also says "The silence of the anonymous companion is, in this regard,
deafening. He could choose to question Socrates about the content of his
narration, but apparently refrains from doing so" (41).[^2]  This is, honestly,
bizarre and preposterous.  There is **no character** that is "the anonymous
companion."  Plato chooses, for whatever reason or reasons, to have Socrates
narrate *Charmides* in the first person, but we are given zero information
about who is listening.  It may be one person or many.  For all we know, it
may be Xanthippe or one of Socrates's sons.  (Cf. the conspiratorial
suggestion by Woolf that Socrates may not have spent his first night back from
military service at home on page 38.)  Compare Plato's *Republic*.  Socrates
narrates that work in the first person, just as he narrates *Charmides* in the
first person.  In both cases, the audience for this narration is not named.
This audience never speaks for any reason; they offer no reactions and they
ask no questions.  In addition, in both works, we never return to the frame of
the narration in any significant sense.  Socrates stops narrating and the
works end.

Woolf remarks on the "fluency" with which Socrates narrates the conversation
in the palaestra, and he suggests this may imply that Socrates had
a remarkable memory.  In a footnote, he adds, "As Fiona Leigh reminds me, one
can overdo this assessment: the dialogue depicts a culture of oral discourse
central to which was a good memory (cf. 159e9); and for all we are told
Socrates may already have been a practised narrator of the events in the
palaestra that he recites" (41, note 19).  Again, this strikes me as bizarre.
Woolf appears to me to be taking *Charmides* literally but not seriously.

NOTE to self: The conclusion of this chapter summarizes many of Woolf's larger
views and goals in the book.

## Chapter 3: Charmides, Eros and the Unity of the Dialogue

In this chapter, Woolf wants to establish "that Socrates' primarity motive for
engaging with Charmides is an erotic one" (60).  Furthermore, Woolf believes
that the same erotic motive also explains why Socrates stops speaking with
Charmides and starts speaking with Critias.  In the first case, Socrates
(temporarily) gives up on Charmides because of erotic disappointment when
Charmides blocks access to his own soul and substitutes someone else's account
of temperance.  In the second case, Socrates talks to Critias  because he
believes that he can thereby continue his "erotic pursuit of Charmides by
other means" (60).  Finally, Woolf insists that Socrates does not care (at
least primarily) about finding out what temperance is.  Instead, Socrates
really cares about the beauty he hopes to find in the soul of Charmides.

Woolf also argues that Socrates uses two "arts" in order to seduce Charmides
(61).  Woolf calls these the "art of erotics" and the "art of soul-medicine"
(61).  The art of erotics helps to "secure the availability of a beautiful, or
prospectively beautiful, soul for the practitioner to behold" (61).  More
generally, Woolf claims that "the theme of eros (erotic desire) gives the
dialogue dramatic unity" (61).

Woolf insists that Plato wants us to notice the radical subjectivity of
perspectives and that we cannot occupy a view from nowhere.  At the same time,
Woolf believes that Plato uses Socrates to teach us that some people can
occupy a point of view that is radically distinct from those of others.  Thus,
Plato encourages us to fight against the "comfort in resting with the idea
that mere subjectivity is the only game in town" (66).  In addition, Woolf
argues that conversation is especially important in *Charmides*.  Only through
conversation does the dialogue imagine that it is possible "to reach a shared
perspective" (67).[^2]

According to Woolf, we should not contrast "cool, detached Socrates" from
others in the dialogue who are "hot and bothered" (70).  The difference
between, e.g., Socrates and Chaerephon is primarily that Chaerephon imagines
stripping Charmides to see his body but Socrates proposes stripping
Charmides’s soul (70).  If we push past the metaphors, however, this may seem
far more benign than Woolf makes it out to be.

Woolf claims that Socrates practices two arts: the art of erotics and the art
of soul-medicine.  The art of soul-medicine has two goals: to determine
whether a soul is beautiful and to make a soul beautiful if it is not yet so
(94).  In other places, Woolf says that soul-medicine "aims at the well-being
of the soul" (104).  The art of erotics has the goal of access to a soul that
is, or can become, beautiful (94).

Re "eros rather than the pursuit of truth drives Socrates", this falls apart
if you let go of agnosticism.  A wider look at other dialogues suggests that
Socrates *primarily* pursues knowledge of what the virtues are for
eudaimonistic or moral reasons.  His claims of erotic desire, if this is
right, should be taken non-literally.  To put this another way, in many
dialogues Socrates and his interlocutors agree that one or another virtue is
κάλον; Socrates and Charmides do so in *Charmides* (see references on 114).
Woolf takes this to mean that insofar as Socrates pursues (knowledge of?)
virtues, he is involved in an "erotic" pursuit.  But this seems to attend only
to the physical or erotic connotations of κάλον at the expense of the moral
or, more broadly, normative senses of the word.

Woolf beats Socrates like a drum when he considers how Socrates rejects the
first definition of temperance that Charmides offers.  Socrates, Woolf says,
"is genuinely careless about interpretation" (117).  He is uncharitable, and
he actively refuses to apply the principle of charity towards Charmides’s
definition (116-117).  However, Woolf partly explains this lack of charity by
arguing that Socrates is punishing Charmides for not following the
instructions that Socrates gives.  Socrates asks Charmides to look within
himself and try to explain what temperance is based on how it makes him.
Instead, Charmides gives a popular, almost proverbial explanation of
temperance.  (Cf. Socrates response that "they say" this about temperance at
159b7-8).

[^1]: However, Woolf seems to violate this acknowledgement when he looks at
    what Socrates says about Chaerephon (33-36).

[^2]: Woolf takes this to suggest something very Platonic about the types of
    things that we can (possibly) agree on.  "It might be argued that [the
    kind of thing in respect of which one can arrive at the truth] would have
    to be of something not itself essentially embedded in the spatiotemporal
    world.  A particular battle or particular body is, in virtue of its
    metaphysical status not accessible other than from particular
    perspectives; and it is not clear, in terms of reaching truth, whether one
    can say more than that, even if conversation provides a means for sharing
    or enlarging perspectives" (67-68).
[^2]: See also "The [anonymous companion's] role as silent recipient of
    testimony is surely also, in the very bareness of its presence as
    a distinct element in the dialogue's vertical structure, there to be
    noticed and interrogated" (42).  Also, Woolf describes how the work prods
    us to see ourselves as enquiring subjects, and he contrasts such enquiry
    with "a possible alternative state (if we note, for example, the prima
    facie attitude of Socrates' silent companion) of mere acquiescence in what
    we are told" (43).  And again, "The companion's apparent lack of critical
    curiosity" (44).
