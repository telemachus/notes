# The Skeptic’s Beliefs
(in *Essays in Ancient Philosophy*; University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis; 1987, pages 179-200)

## Introduction

> There are no views or beliefs that define Pyrrhonean Skepticism (179).

Frede begins from the claim above. He explains that sceptics don’t have “any specific doctrines or dogmas” that set them apart from any other school of philosophy. We shouldn’t even attribute the view that “nothing can be known” to these sceptics. After all, they claim that Academics are really (negative) dogmatists since they claim that nothing can be known. So, there is nothing a Pyrrhonian must admit simply insofar as they are a Pyrrhonian. In particular, they do not claim to have a deeper insight into things that allows them to refute the views of other schools. It is dogmatists who believe such things.

Frede contrasts this, however, with “a far more radical” interpretation of the sceptics (179). According to this “usual interpretation”, the sceptics disavow all knowledge (179), and they suspend judgement on all matters. They lack all knowledge and all belief.

Frede views this alternative view, however common, as “fundamentally mistaken” (179) and for at least two reasons. First, sceptics “cannot avoid knowing many things”. It would require “great effort, imagination, and cleverness” to make onself “know less and less”. Since we don’t have a reason to think the sceptics are trying to do any such thing, we can assume that they “simply cannot avoid knowing many things” and also that they will “often be aware of knowing, and not merely supposing, certain things” (179-180). And Frede doesn’t believe that this is incompatible with Sextus’s scepticism. Second, whatever we think about knowledge, Frede also thinks that (i) the sceptic has beliefs and (ii) these beliefs are compatible with Pyrrhonian scepticism. He will focus on belief in this essay, though I wish he had said more about knowledge.

## A problem for the standard interpretation

Frede concedes that a great deal suggests the standard view, but he raises what he takes to be a serious objection to the standard. There is a (pragmatic) inconsistency between having no beliefs whatsoever and doing anything at all. Frede refers in particular to Hume’s version of the objection that “if only he took his own views seriously”, the sceptic “would be completely helpless in ordinary life” (180). And Frede adds that ancient sceptics faced such an objection no later than Arcesilaus.

Frede argues on the basis of charity that we should take the sceptics more seriously in response to the *apraxia* argument. Since they faced various versions of the argument over hundreds of years, we should not lightly dismiss their counter-arguments. As he puts it “one violates the canons of interpretation if one does not take the skeptics’ constant protests—that this objection does not really tell against their position—at least as seriously as the fact taht they were constantly confronted by it” (180).

Frede imagines two different ways that the sceptics might argue in defense of their position. (i) They might argue that it is possible to avoid all beliefs and that doing so is compatible with action and (some form of) ordinary life. (ii) They might argue that although they suspend judgement on all matters in some sense, this suspension is compatible with having beliefs. And such beliefs make it possible for the sceptics to act and have a life. Frede believes that the sceptics took the second path. But before he gets into that, he considers three reasons to believe that they took the first path.

Here are those three reasons:

1. Sceptics often say that they suspend all beliefs.
1. Pyrrho may have attempted to live without belief, and he is generally thought of as a source of Pyrrhonian scepticism.
1. Sceptics often argue that action is possible without belief. This might look as though they are trying to fight off an objection to their own position.

Briefly, here are Frede’s responses to these arguments.

1. He passes over this except to note that “it will turn out that it is only true in a restricted sense...and that everything depends on how one construes this restriction” (181).
1. The evidence for Pyrrho’s life comes from Antigonus of Carystus, who was a near contemporary of Pyrrho’s. Frede doesn’t think that we can rule out that Antigonus meant this as serious biography, and not as a “critical caricature” (181). (If it were merely a caricature, then it would not be evidence for anything but the view that scepticism makes ordinary life impossible. It could not then itself be evidence for the appropriateness of this attack without begging the question.) However, Frede doesn’t think that we need to worry very much about what Pyrrho did since (i) all other sceptics seem to have led very ordinary lives and (ii) “Pyrrho’s influence on Pyrrhonean skepticism is far less than generally assumed” (182).
1. If we interpret sceptical arguments as their own solution to the challenge of *apraxia*—a solution that they accept, even if we don’t—then the sceptic “would be trying to deny what quite obviously is the case, viz., that actions presuppose beliefs, by relying on a theoretical dogmatic argument which purports to show that action is possible even without assent to appearances” (184). But this is precisely what a sceptic “usually criticizes the dogmatist for doing”. Thus Frede prefers to see the arguments that sceptics offer against dogmatic *apraxia* arguments as cases of the sceptic “simply following their usual strategy of providing equipollent arguments on both sides of every issue”. In addition, Frede argues that it is “scarcely plausible” to imagine a sceptic actually arguing for a more or less normal human life without any beliefs. In addition to the theoretical problem, which the arguments for action without belief might address, there is a practical problem. In the normal course of life, people acquire beliefs. A sceptic would need to show us (i) how to rid ourselves of all previous beliefs, (ii) how to prevent forming new ones, and (iii) how (i) and (ii) can be done in such a way that what is left is still recognizable as a human life at all. The problem is that even if we can imagine ways to accomplish (i)-(iii), “what, besides sheer dogmatism, would lead someone to make use of this possibility” (184). (Note: I think that critics of Frede’s position have not adequately answered this two-part argument: the practical problem and the dogmatism it suggests.)

Frede then considers a possible objection that it is not dogmatism but the experience of tranquillity that leads the sceptic “to resist the ordinary way of thinking about things” (185). Frede offers two responses. The first response relies on his larger interpretation of the sceptic’s ἐποχή, so I will pass over that for now. Frede also responds that the objection doesn’t answer the practical problem: “For while this objection could perhaps explain why the skeptic leads a life without beliefs, once he has discovered that a life without beliefs is a tranquil one, our problem was seeing what would lead the skeptic to discover this in the first place. For the skeptic to make this discovery, however, he must either bring it about that he is in a state in which he has no beliefs or somehow be put into such a state. What, though, could bring him into such a state, on what grounds coul he bring himself into such a state; they could only be dogmatic ones” (185).

Perhaps we can blunt the force of Frede’s argument here. He seems to believe that the sceptic’s discovery of tranquillity is all or nothing. That is, the sceptic only comes to ἀταραξία after she loses *all* of her beliefs. At first, we might think that we can interpret *PH* I 12 in another way. Perhaps Sextus says there only that we discover tranquillity piecemeal; for each belief we give up, we gain *some* peace of mind. However, if we turn to the text, this isn’t the case. Instead, Sextus says very clearly συστάσεως δὲ τῆς σκεπτικῆς ἐστὶν ἀρχὴ μάλιστα τὸ *παντὶ λόγῷ* λόγον ἴσον ἀντικεῖσθαι· ἀπὸ γὰρ τούτου καταλήγειν δοκοῦμεν εἰς τὸ μὴ δογματίζειν (I 12, emphasis mine). And it is immediately after this that Sextus explains in what sense a sceptic does or does not δογματίζειν.
