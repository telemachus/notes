# Craft and Fineness in Plato’s *Ion* (OSAP, X 1992, 1-23)

Janaway concludes thus (22):

> Plato’s view is that the ability to speak correctly, truly, or wisely stems
> from knowledge or *tekhnē*, to possess which is to apply to a clear
> subject-matter rational principles which can be made explicit. To speak finely
> or beautifully, as a poet, performer, or eulogist, so as to bring about
> pleasure and emotional involvement in an audience, is not at all a matter of
> knowledge or *tekhnē*, but receives its explanation in terms of a particular
> lack of full rational, conscious control over one’s actions.

Earlier, Janaway sums up his claims about τέχνη and inspiration in this way (19):

> Ion’s success as a eulogist—his success in revealing Homer’s greatness in his
> public lectures—cannot stem from a *tekhnē*, because he is following no
> generalizable principles and because in this role he is authoritative on no
> definite subject-matter. Yet he is a fine eulogist. Whence this fineness?
> Clearly it stems, like that of poetry and rhapsodic acting, from the
> inspiration that affects him when he performs scenes from Homer. All of this,
> I have suggested, is compatible with Plato’s assuming that there are *tekhnai*
> of poetry and rhapsody.

Still earlier, Janaway says this (15):

> The rhapsodic *tekhnē*, if there is one, does not entitle Ion to speak with
> knowledge about any one of the crafts portrayed in Homer, and certainly does
> not entitle him to speak about all of them. Indeed, the rhapsodic *tekhnē*, if
> there is one, seems not to entitle Ion to speak knowledgeably about
> anything—which Plato must find peculiar. Nevertheless, it is still compatible
> with the dialogue’s ending that there should be a rhapsodic craft. The point
> is that, if there is such a craft, its practioner speaks *finely* rather than
> *knowledgeably* when discoursing on his favourite poet, and that such fine
> speaking is precisely what cannot be explained by a mastery of *tekhnē*.

I grant that the position Janaway gives Plato is a *possible* interpretation of
the text, but the position makes very little sense on its own, and it seems to
conflict with several other basic Platonic positions. As such, I think we should
search for a different interpretation.

My problems with Janaway’s position are as follows:

1. Janaway leaves very little for the poetic or rhapsodic craft to explain.
   A poet makes fine (καλόν) poetry, and a rhapsode performs finely, not because
   of τέχνη but because of inspiration. However, they do possess τέχναι. What
   then do those τέχναι explain? Perhaps they explain how a poet, or rhapsode,
   meets the minimal criteria of their art? So, for example, the τέχνη of a poet
   explains how the poet writes (minimally?) metrical poems, using the
   appropriate diction, while the τέχνη of the rhapsode explains how the
   rhapsode remembers all of Homer’s epics and how the rhapsode can rapidly find
   just the right passage for any request. Here’s a question for this position:
   if a poet or rhapsode performs according to their τέχνη but without
   inspiration, what should we say about their performance? On the one hand, we
   should say that they perform well—or perhaps competently? But this doesn’t
   appear to be what Socrates, Kant, or Janaway say. They seem to say that such
   a poet is bad (or “merely competent” in a way that suggests bad.) **TODO**:
   add references. Note also that Socrates shows zero interest in any of these
   features that show (mere) technical competency. I’m unsure if that helps or
   hurts Janaway’s position.
2. Plato normally considers good (ἀγαθόν), fine (καλόν), and “done by knowledge
   or craft” (various phrases involving ἐπιστήμη and τέχνη) to be equivalent—or
   at least transitive. But Janaway appears to draw a distinction between the
   “good” features of a poem or rhapsodic performance and the “fine” features of
   the same. Also, Janaway himself is inconsistent about this distinction, if
   I am right that he draws one at all. **TODO**: figure out what the hell
   Janaway has in mind here.
