# L’épicurisme: école et tradition, Diskin Clay

(in *Lire Épicure et les épicuriens*, edd. Alain Gigandet and Pierre-Marie Morel)

## Les débuts

The name ‘Epicurus’ is relatively rare in Greek, though several disciples of Epicurus name their children after the Master. Clay reminds us that the ἐκίκουροι in Plato’s *Republic* are subordinates who help the Guardians of the ideal city. Socrates mentions these allies near the myth of the division of citizens into metals, gold, silver, and bronze (415 A). Clay notes that for many historians of philosophy, ancient and modern, Epicurus himself has belonged to the race of silver (at best?), while Plato is the race of gold. However, the disciples of Epicurus viewed their master as a universal herald and savior (5).

Epicurus was an Athenian, but he was not born in Athens. In this way, Epicurus was unlike Plato but similar to Aristotle (from Macedonia) and Zeno (from Citium) (6). Epicurus was born in 341 on Samos to parents who emigrated from Athens. He died in Athens in 270 (6). Epicurus arrived in Athens around 307 or 306, during the archonship of Anaxicrates. Among several ancient lives or biographical sketches of Epicurus, the most important is that of Diogenes Laertius. (His work inspired many of the others that we have.) In addition, Diogenes of Oeneanda provides us with two letters of Epicurus which teach us about the early years of his life (6).

We don’t know a great deal about the details of his doctrines or manner of life in Athens, but we do know that he attracted several disciples and students in his lifetime. In particular, he was close with people from Lesbos and Lampsacus, and he remained close with them throughout his life. Clay mentions several voyages to Lampsacus that show up in Epicurus’s letters and that one of his final letters, on his deathbed, was written to Idomeneus of Lampsacus (6-7).

Clay attributes some of the attraction of Epicureanism to the sense of φιλία, which was closer to a family than friendship, in the Garden. He also connects the frequent use of personal letters (with a more public and official message) to this sense of family among the members. He notes in passing that we have letters as far back as 300/299 and as late as 271/270 (8-9).
