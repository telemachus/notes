# Some notes on irony in Plato's dialogues

## Words and concepts

The ancient Greek εἰρωνεία normally means something like 'deception'.
Modern irony tends to mean 'saying one thing but meaning the other'. In
addition, in modern irony, the speaker (normally) *wants* the listener (or
at least some part of the audience) to grasp the real meaning. Hence,
normally irony and εἰρωνεία are do not refer to the same concept.

But even if the two words do not *normally* refer to the same concept, that
doesn't mean that they *never* do so. The problem remains: Is Socrates ever
ironic in our sense? Is he always deceptive?

## Whose irony?

We should distinguish between irony that comes from Socrates the character
and irony that comes from Plato the author. In the first case, Socrates
himself would be intending to convey some other message via his words. We
would need to ask who the intended target was. In the second case, Plato
would be speaking through the characters to his readers. Platonic irony is
therefore a form of dramatic irony: author and audience know more than the
characters.

## Deception and sincerity

Some writers don't like the idea that Socrates deceives, but how much
should that bother us? If we are not already Kantians about deception, it
may not matter so much to us that Socrates sometimes lies or tries to
deceive his interlocutors. Even more importantly--and even if we are
Kantians--maybe Socrates lies and deceives, no matter what we would prefer
him to do.
