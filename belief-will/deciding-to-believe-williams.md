# Bernard Williams, “Deciding to believe,” in *Problems of the Self (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973), 136-151.

Williams begins by limiting his area of interest. He is not interested in
religious or moral beliefs. Instead, Williams proposes first to say a bit about
what it means to believe something and then “to discuss…how far, if at all,
believing something can be related to decision and will” (136). For his
examples, Williams will use simple factual beliefs rather than moral or
religious beliefs. Williams does not say why, but I suppose he worries that
moral or religious beliefs may be more loaded or create additional problems.
