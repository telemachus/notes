# "When and Why Did Plato Write Narrated Dialogues?", Malcolm Schofield

According to Schofield, the following are narrated dialogues: *Charmides*,
*Lysis*, *Euthydemus*, *Phaedo*, *Symposium*, *Protagoras*, *Republic*, and
*Parmenides* (42).  He says that "perhaps" we can include the speech of
Critias about Atlantis from *Timaeus*.  This would be "narrative *within*
a scripted dialogue" (42, his emphasis).  Schofield excludes *Theaetetus*,
which "starts as if it is going to be a further instance of this type but then
tells us it is not going to do narrative" (42).[^1]

Schofield answers the when question by saying that narration is "the preferred
mode of Plato's middle period" (43).  Schofield expands on this by describing
the following history of Plato as writer.  Plato begins by writing very simple
(two person, short) scripted dialogues.  E.g., *Ion* and *Hippias Minor*.  Then
he writes more complex scripted dialogues (longer, with more speakers or
both). E.g., *Gorgias* and *Laches*.  Then he writes narrated dialogues in his
middle period.  E.g., *Protagoras* and *Charmides*.  Finally, in *Theaetetus*
Plato explicitly disavows narrated dialogues and returns to scripted dialogue
for the rest of his career.

Schofield distinguishes the following sub-groups among the narrated dialogues.

+ Socrates himself narrates conversations with young men at a gym:
  *Charmides*, *Lysis*, *Euthydemus*.  *Protagoras* is similar but with a bit
  of extra frame at the start.
+ Someone other than Socrates narrates a Socratic conversation: *Symposium*,
  *Phaedo*, *Parmenides*.  *Theaetetus* would have belonged to this category
  if it had remained narrated.  If we include Critias in *Timaeus*, this too
  belongs in this category.
+ *Republic*, which stands apart from the rest.

Schofield considers the first group to belong to a proper genre that he calls
"erotic dialogue" (45).  He compares Aeschines's *Alcibiades* with *Charmides*
in an interesting manner.

*Euthydemus* is unusual among the dialogues narrated by Socrates.  In this
case, Socrates narrates to Crito.  Crito and Socrates talk a bit at the start,
there's an intermission where they talk again, and they talk at the end of the
dialogue.  This is all relatively elaborate compared with the other narrated
dialogues.

[^1]: I disagree with Schofield on the status of *Theaetetus*.  It is an
    internal narrator who says that he has chosen to write the work as
    a dialogue rather than narrating it out.  Thus, *Theaetetus* calls more
    attention to its formal qualities, in this sense, than many of the other
    narrated dialogues.
