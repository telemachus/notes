Christopher Warne does two things especially well in this new book. First,
he skillfully combines two approaches to Plato that commonly clash.
Following Debra Nails,[[1]] we can call these the literary-contextualist
and the analytic-developmentalist styles. The first reads individual
dialogues closely and independently, paying careful attention to literary
techniques and historical allusions. The second cares almost solely for
arguments, downplays the dramatic structure of Plato's writing and happily
puts together arguments on the basis of premises drawn from multiple
dialogues. The second strength of <i>Arguing with Socrates</i> is that it
forces readers to think for themselves. Warne generally proceeds
dialectically: he looks at arguments from many sides, but doesn't argue for
his own conclusions. For both reasons this book should prove very useful to
its target audience, namely early-level undergraduates.

The book contains two main sections. The first, which is much briefer at 28
pages, has two chapters: 'People' and 'How Socrates argues'. The second
section spans just shy of 150 pages and offers nine chapters on individual
dialogues: <i>Apology</i>, <i>Crito</i>, <i>Euthyphro</i>, <i>Hippias
Major</i>, <i>Ion</i>, <i>Laches</i>, <i>Meno</i>, <i>Protagoras</i>,
<i>Symposium</i>. None of the chapters strictly require any other, and in
theory they could be read individually and in any order. (As I'll explain
later, I think this is another strength of the book.)

Although the chapters on specific dialogues form the backbone of Warne's
project, the second chapter, 'How Socrates argues', is one of the strongest
in the book. Warne manages to introduce students briefly but clearly to
central questions about Socratic methodology. He covers the
<i>elenchus</i>, Socratic definitions (i.e. the 'What is F-ness?'
questions), Socratic ignorance and irony (both Socratic and Platonic). In
addition, Warne provides excellent coverage of Socratic epagoge for
non-specialists. In particular, he explains that most of the arguments
employing epagoge are not inductive proofs but rather illustrations that
reveal the concept of a universal to interlocutors (and readers).

The chapters on individual dialogues all follow the same structure. For
each dialogue, Warne considers (1) the dramatic situation, (2) the central
theme and (3) the specific arguments in the text. The sections on drama
give important historical background and sometimes discuss the dialogues as
dramatic works, that is as literature. When discussing themes, Warne pulls
back from Plato altogether. For example, in the chapter on <i>Laches</i>
Warne talks about courage — whether or not it is a virtue, whether we can
properly describe a criminal as being 'brave' while doing something
vicious. Warne explains in the preface that he is sometimes deliberately
provocative in these sections in order to open up the reader's mind. The
last section in each chapter moves through the dialogue sequentially and
carefully unpacks the arguments that Socrates and the interlocutors make.
In these sections, Warne generally avoids coming down on one side or
another. He describes the arguments and comments on strengths or
weaknesses, but he abstains from telling the reader what to conclude.

We can get a better sense of Warne's goals and style by comparing his book
with two other introductory works on Socrates, C. C. W. Taylor's
<i>Socrates</i> in Oxford's Very Short Introduction series and George
Rudebusch's <i>Socrates</i> in Blackwell's Great Mind series. Taylor and
Warne are surveys without an overarching single thesis, while Rudebusch
presents a unified and novel interpretation of Socrates. Rudebusch and
Taylor argue towards specific conclusions, but Warne, as I said above,
mostly explores arguments without picking one view over another. Rudebusch
and Taylor could be read piecemeal, but really seem intended to be read in
order all the way through. Warne is the other way around: You could read it
cover to cover, but it invites reading chapters in any order. Taylor and
Warne focus solely on Socrates as he appears in Plato; Taylor gives Plato
pride of place, but he also considers Aristophanes and Xenophon, among
others. Taylor and Warne are both pitched at a very introductory level, but
Rudebusch makes more demands on his readers. Rudebusch and Warne are very
much aimed at philosophers, while Taylor would also suit Classicists or the
elusive "general reader".

As much as these three books overlap, they each have distinct best uses.
Taylor provides the best introduction to Socrates as a historical
individual, and Rudesusch offers the most challenging and detailed
interpretation of Socratic philosophy <i>as a whole</i>. Warne, however,
gives the most guidance to less experienced students. In particular, he
does the most to walk such students carefully through the arguments of the
nine dialogues he covers. He shows students, by example, how to analyze and
assess philosophical claims. <i>Arguing with Socrates</i> would be
especially useful for first- or second-year students who were new to
writing philosophical papers. Since Warne poses questions rather than
giving answers, there is still plenty of room for students to explore their
own views, but Warne has prepared the ground well for them in advance.

For such students, I recommend this book enthusiastically, but I do have
one significant reservation. Warne is not always at his best when
discussing history and biography. This is not surprising, since Warne says
repeatedly that the book is meant to be for philosophers not historians. In
addition, Warne mentions that he sometimes makes deliberately provocative
historical claims in order to stimulate readers[[2]]. But whether he is
playing devil's advocate or simply not being sufficiently critical, he
makes a number of claims that concern me. For example, Warne says, without
any further elaboration, that Socrates may have worked as a mason or
a usurer (5). He treats the Second Letter as evidence for Plato's views as
an author (183). And Warne suggests that we might re-evaluate the courage
Socrates displayed as a soldier since "he excelled himself in
<i>retreat</i>" (5).[[3]]

The overwhelming majority of these questionable claims or provocations
appear in Chapter 1, 'People'. To be frank, I would recommend that students
skip this chapter. Playing devil's advocate can work well for philosophical
arguments, since a student needs only patience and thought to respond
there. But in the case of historical facts, students are not easily able to
assess Warne's claims, especially since he often omits mention of his
(ancient or modern) sources. As a result, I think that Chapter 1 is the
exception in an otherwise very student-friendly and useful book about
Plato's Socrates.

So in sum <i>Arguing with Socrates</i> is a stimulating introduction to the
philosophical methods of Socrates and to nine important Socratic dialogues.
It best suits introductory-level readers, and (with the exception of
Chapter 1) I recommend it very strongly.

n=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/#2.2>Nail's article on
Socrates</u> from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

[[2]] See pages 4 and 7 in the first chapter. In a similar spirit, note
what Warne says on page xi of the preface.

[[3]] The emphasis is Warne's. I find this suggestion particularly
outrageous. It runs directly against the clear implication of the passage
Warne seems to have in mind. What Laches says in that passage
(<i>Laches</i> 181B) is that if the Athenian army had possessed more
soldiers like Socrates <i>they would not have needed to retreat at all</i>.
That is, they would have won the battle of Delium. It is sheer bad faith to
turn this into "Socrates was a great soldier—when he was running away."
