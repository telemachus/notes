# *The Shape of Athenian Law*, S.C. Todd

## Method

### The Legacy of Athenian Law

The Greeks had a huge effect on subsequent societies, but not in the area of law. Their legal system had effectively no legacy. The ideas and words of subsequant legal systems come largely from Rome rather than Greece. A parallel case is religion where the Judeo-Christian tradition dominates the future.

Most modern and contemporary thinking about law derives from Roman ways of thinking about law. In the Roman system, (i) law is a normative discipline, (ii) the rules of law are independent of their social context, to one degree or another, and (iii) there should be a formal and systematic statement of the laws.

But none of these principles fits Athens well. Todd will argue that “law is never simply a normative discipline” (13). And in Athens there was no formal statements of their laws.

Because Athenian law is so different from what we are used to, Todd believes that existing scholarship has problems organizing the discussion of Athenian law. Since the Athenians themselves had no theory or overall structure for their laws or legal system, we can’t use that to organize our accounts. But if we use some other organization, e.g., the Roman one or English common-law, we risk misrepresenting the Athenian material. Many scholars have taken this route, and Todd doesn’t love the results. On the other hand, MacDowell avoids theory and methodology altogether, and that’s a problem too. Todd wants to minimize both problems, though he also thinks that in the end the problem is “probably insoluble” (16).

### Comparisons, Assumptions, and the Concept of ‘Shape’

Todd spends this chapter making a very modern point. He believes that he cannot completely avoid the perspective that he comes from, but he still wants to achieve some level of rationality in his approach. In order to do so, he will turn to legal anthropology and comparisons with American, British, and European systems. He hopes to avoid importing too much from Roman-based or contemporary systems, and that is why he turns to anthropology. In theory, anthropology will show how different things can be from what we know.

### Sources of Law: Sources of Information

Todd divides his investigation of sources into two chapters. In this first chapter, he considers how later historians and readers reconstruct Athenian law. In the next chapter, he considers how Athenians worked out what their own laws were. He says the first question is one for historians and the second question is one for lawyers.

Our main source for Athenian law is the speeches of the ten orators. Todd insists that we cannot trust these speeches. They are not case reports but lawyers’s speeches. A lawyer may lie about the facts and the law. In addition, we cannot be sure if the speeches were edited after delivery. If they were edited for publication, we cannot say where or how much.

### Sources of Law: Legal Sources

Todd begins by reviewing the sources of law in contemporary legal systems. Although he distinguishes carefully between the Continental tradition and the British/American system (the civil-law and the common-law systems), they both rely on three elements. Contemporary systems rely on statue law, customary law (precedents set by judges), and juristic writings (made by academic lawyers).
