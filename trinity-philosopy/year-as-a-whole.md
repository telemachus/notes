# The big picture

If I use the fall (Lucretius) to discuss (i) Presocratics, (ii) Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and (iii) the Hellenistic schools and then I use the spring (Descartes) to discuss (i) late ancient, (ii) medieval, and (iii) early modern philosophy and I include *a little* contemporary material in both semesters, then I get a history of philosophy in the year.

One job for the summer: plan this out more fully.
