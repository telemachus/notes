# How to Be a Pyrrhonist: The Practice and Significance of Pyrrhonian Skepticism, Richard Bett

## Preface

+ Bett will avoid “the development of the Pyrrhonist skeptical tradition, from Pyrrho himself through Aenesidemus to Sextus Empiricus” since this is in his book *Pyrrho, His Antecedents, and His Legacy* and people know this side of his work well (vii-viii). Only the earliest essay, chapter 4, makes development “a major focus of attention” (viii).
+ All essays in this book date from 2005 or later: earliest is 2005, and several are forthcoming in edited volumes.
+ Bett decided not to include (1) papers for “handbook or companion volumes” and (2) anything with “a lot of discussion of the Greek language and matters of translation.” He also avoided (3) essays that focus on the Academic side of ancient skepticism.
+ Most chapters focus on Pyrhhonist skepticism as found in Sextus Empiricus.
+ Bett presents the essays as having two main themes: (1) the practice of Pyrrhonism, “a closer look at how it actually works in detail” (ix) and (2) the contemporary relevance of Pyrrhonism, “rather than being of purely antiquarian interest, <Pyrrhonism> often raises questions that may make a difference to people today” (ix-x).
+ The book itself has four parts: (i) How the Pyrrhonists Present Themselves, (ii) Pyrrhonists at Work: Specific Topics, (iii) Life as a Pyrrhonist, and (iv) Intersections of Pyrrhonism with Contemporary Thought
+ Bett identifies four main areas where he sees “some differences in perspective between different chapters.” I.e., these are places where he sees conflicts in his own interpretations over time. (1) Is it “a defect or a virtue” that the skeptic lacks “robust commitment to ethical or other values.” (2) Sextus gives two different accounts of “how suspesion of judgment yields *ataraxia*”; are they “consistent with one another”? (3) Sextus wants to view “suspension of judgment as a psychological effect rather than a rational commitment.” Can we sustain this “across the entirety of his thought”? (4) Is Sextus hopeless inconsistent or subtly meta. For example, he claims that he is a genuine inquirer but also has a “well-honed procedure for bringing about suspenion of judgment.” Also, he claims to practice religion “in the same way as an ordinary member of society.” Can he consistently support these claims? Bett thinks he has not been consistent  in his answers to these four questions (x-xi).
+ I might add as a fifth item, the question of rationality and the skeptics. Gisela Striker raises this question. How much does Bett himself discuss it?
+ He has decided to transliterate nearly all Greek. Argh.

## The Pyrrhonist’s Dilemma: What to Write If You Have Nothing to Say

+ “seemingly willful blindness to reality of large sections of the voting population, in some countries at least” (3).

> Has [Sextus] too given up on any attempt to discover the truth, and if so, does he consider this condition preferable to that of the philosophers who retain this desire? (3).

Bett says mostly yes to this question “although the matter is not entirely straightforward (3).

This leads Bett to his main concerns in this chapter: “To the extend that Sextus has indeed given up on the search for truth, what is his purpose in writing what are clearly, in some sense, philosophical works, and what strategies of writing does he employ given that purpose? (4). Bett believes that there is an important question there since “a skeptic who does write had better be careful not to seem like a philosopher of the usual stripe” (4).

According to Bett, Sextus thinks that skeptics “are people who started out with the goal of discovering the truth” (4), but this “is not a goal held purely for its own sake” (4). The *telos* or aim in life for skeptics is *ataraxia*. (Bett ignores *metriopatheia* though he acknowledges that, strictly speaking, Sextus limits *ataraxia* to “matters of opinion” (Bett 4, PH 1.25).

CONCERN: Bett presents the skeptics as sharing “the goal of discovering the truth” and the *telos* of *ataraxia* with non-skeptical philosophers. He writes “Sextus may well also have believed (not without some warrant) that this goal (viz. *ataraxia*), too, was much more widely shared; certainly his accounts of how and why the skeptic is better off than non-skeptical philosophers (PH 1.25-30, 3.235-238, M 11.110-167) appeal to the skeptic’s tranquility by contrast with the extreme anxiety of the others, as if it is common ground that tranquility is what it makes most sense ultimately to aim for” (4). I worry that Bett does not do justice to the dialectical situation in these passages. For example, in PH 1.25-30, Sextus may still be answering the concerns of the previous sections: what does a life “without belief” look like, how is such a life possible, and is the skeptical life a possibly good life, or even best life? I wonder if we should take Sextus as offering us a parody of a straight philosophical answer with *ataraxia* borrowed from the Epicureans and *metriopatheia* borrowed from the Aristotelians. In any case, Bett writes as though Sextus is a dogmatist who uses (selective) skepticism for instrumental reasons. Sextus believes that (1) *ataraxia* is the best life and (2) suspension of belief is the best (only?) way to reach *ataraxia*. The skeptic discovers, fortuitously (τυχικῶς), that (3) disagreement of equal strength will yield suspension of belief and *ataraxia*. After the initial accidental discovery, the skeptic deliberately works towards disagreement of equal strength in order to maintain *ataraxia*. Someone (Gisela Striker, I think) shows that Sextus often uses terms from his philosophical rivals in ways that would tweak them. Would that help here?

Perin and Bett agree that the skeptic cannot both (1) engage in serious inquiry seeking at truth and (2) “desire to create an intellectual equipoise (and thereby to produce tranquility)” (6). Perin discounts evidence of (2) while Bett discounts evidence of (1). Bett mentions the modes as an example for his side, specifically “how [Sextus] introduces the Modes (PH 1.31-34, 36)” (7). (Compare Morison “The Sceptic’s Modes of Argumentation,” in *Dialectice after Plato and Aristotle*?) Bett grants that Sextus might be an inquirer if we weaken the term: “If ‘inquiry’ simply means not having decided that one knows the truth or that the truth is unknowable, then the skeptic, as Sextus characterizes him, is indeed an inquirer. But the claim that the skeptic ‘is still investigating,’ sounds as if it promises more than this; and that is the promise on which the rest of his work does not deliver” (8).

Bett next asks why Sextus writes, given that his goal is suspension of judgment. Other philosophers “generally write with a view to leading the reader most effectively toward whatever conclusions they consider justified” (8). Bett imagines the writings of Sextus as “an aspect, or an illustration” of the skeptical ability to generate or maintain suspension of judgment (8). He believes, however, that the works do not read like private exercises, and he contrasts Sextus’s books with Marcus Aurelius’s and some of Seneca’s writings in that regard. He says “the tone of instruction, of the dissemination of a message to readers, is present throughout his work” (9).

Who are the readers? Bett imagine three “not mutually exclusive” groups: (1) other philosophers who attack skepticism; (2) readers who do not know skepticism and who are not themselves dogmatists; outsiders to philosophy generally; and (3) fellow skeptics.

Why does Sextus write? The answers will vary depending on which group he has in mind at any given moment. For (1), Sextus writes to rebut criticism. For group (2), Sextus tries to win converts and cure sufferers. For (3), Sextus offers “a wealth of material in their quest to maintain suspension of judgment and tranquility” (11). In the case of all three groups, “his writings are designed to exemplify or express the suspension of judgment that he identifies as the route to tranquility” (11).

How will these audiences and goals affect how Sextus writes? Bett argues that Sextus “must not give the impression that he thinks he is *winning* the argument; instead, he must generate a sense of stalemate” (11, his emphasis). According to Bett, Sextus does this partly by choosing his arguments (and their strength) very carefully.

What literary devices does Sextus use to create this sense of stalemate? Bett lists the following: (1) the special skeptical phrases that Sextus discusses in Book 1 seem “designed to protect [skeptics] from making any assertions that go beyond the realm of how things appear to them” (15) and (2) variation. As types of variation, Bett lists (1) variations in the use of terms, (2) variations in strategic decisions, (3) and variations in the ways arguments are presented. Bett himself connects these variations to “inconsistency or incompetence,” but he doesn’t want us to equate one with the other. Sextus varies in these ways “deliberately...to put the reader into a position where he or she does not know what to think — and thereby both minimizing the risk of seeming himself to hold definite positions and nudging the reader toward a suspensive state of mind” (15).

CONCERN: taken seriously, I’m not sure that Sextus is doing philosophy at all, if Bett is right. If Bett is right, there are no arguments in Sextus, as we normally understand arguments. What Sextus presents are, in fact, play arguments, mock arguments, or rhetorical arguments.

> this [prima facie conflict] at least raises the suspicion that Sextus is deliberately playing with his readers, encouraging them to ponder how far the skeptic can be considered a normal person, and how far ordinary life should be seen as the polar opposite of philosophical reflection. As in the previous case, there are no simple answers; and the effect may be to drive us toward yet another form of suspension of judgment (20).

## Why Care Whether Skepticism Is Different from Other Philosophies?

Sextus is weird: while most philosophers and schools strive to show how they are connected to more ancient predecessors, Sextus “takes considerable pains to show that Pyrrhonism is *different* from other philosophies” (25, Bett’s emphasis). Bett adds “He is not even especially eager to admit debts to earlier Pyrrhonists” (25).

NOTE: Sextus implies that Cyrenaics differ from skeptics because they “strongly assert their end” (διαβεβαιούμενος τελος, *PH* 1.215). Can Sextus save himself from some of the problems of *having an end* by saying that he doesn’t strongly assert that end? I think no because whether or not he strongly asserts his end, he is willing to fudge arguments in order to reach it.

CONCERN: Bett has not added cross-references. They could help. E.g., I’d love a cross-reference between the discussion of “so-called philosophy” on pages 42-43 and the discussion on 15-17.

Bett sees “two implications” in Sextus’s use of “so-called [*kaloumenês* or *legomenês*] philosophy” (42): (1) such philosophers claim to do something that they fail to do and (2) Sextus wants nothing to do with this understanding of “what philosophy is or should be” (42).
