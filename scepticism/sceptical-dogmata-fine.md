# Sceptical *dogmata*: *Outlines of Pyrrhonism* I 13
(Gail Fine: *Méthexis* volume 13, 2000, 81-105)

## Introduction

Fine begins from the especially “vexed” question “whether ancient sceptics disavow all, or only some, beliefs” (81). She proposes to consider the no belief and the some belief view, and she specifies that she is only here concerned with what the sceptics claim about their beliefs. That is, she acknowledges that it may be difficult to understand what it means to hold, literally, no beliefs, but for the moment, she only cares about what the sceptics say—whether or not what they claim is genuinely possible.

Fine begins by distinguishing two questions:
1. Do sceptics disavow all, or only some δόγματα?[^1]
1. Do they disavow all, or only some, beliefs, as we understand belief?
Fine describes (1) as an internal question and (2) as an external question. (1) is a matter of what the sceptics say “in their own words” (81) while (2) is a matter of whether the sceptics have belief by our lights.

According to Fine the internal question is easy to answer, but the external one is hard in more than one way. (1) is easy to settle since in I 13, Sextus “explicitly says that sceptics have δόγματα. However, we are still left with (2), which remains a very difficult problem. First, it can be difficult to map what Sextus says onto modern views about belief. Second, there is no *one* “agreed concept of belief that ‘we’ all share: belief is understood in various ways” (81). Fine proposes first to explain what she will mean by belief and then to determine whether Sextus says that sceptics have beliefs if “belief” is understood as Fine understands it. She severely limits the scope of her study: she considers only Sextus, and in fact only a very small portion of *PH* Book I.[^2]

## Belief

Fine begins this section by noting that very little has been written about belief, especially compared to knowledge. That is, everyone agrees that knowledge is a difficult and complex concept, but philosophers tend to take belief “for granted”. However, it is not obvious that belief is so simple nor that people agree on what belief is. Fine tells us that she will discuss the (different) views of belief in Burnyeat and Frede, and then she will lay out her view of belief.

Burnyeat and Frede disagree over the connection between belief and truth. Burnyeat thinks that “if A believes p, A takes p to be true” (82). As Fine writes, this is “hardly idiosyncratic” (82). In fact, many people think that this connection between truth and belief is true by definition.[^3] However, not everyone agrees. Frede, for example rejects what Fine calls “the standard view” (83). Frede argues that there is a difference between (i) having a view and (ii) making a claim or taking a position. Both are cases of belief, but only the second involves taking as true.

Fine considers several possible interpretations of Frede’s view over several pages, and in the end, she rejects his claim. According to Fine, Frede never establishes a sense of belief that is (i) limited and specific enough to be useful[^4] and also (ii) doesn’t involve taking as true. In order to continue with the main line of thought, I’m going to put my notes on this section in an appendix at the end rather than here.

At the end of this section, Fine gives her own view of belief and she makes clear where she stands vis-à-vis the rival interpretations of Burnyeat and Frede. Fine agrees with Burnyeat that belief requires taking something as true. However, she disagrees with *both* Frede and Burnyeat on sceptics and truth. Both Burnyeat and Frede agree that the sceptics “don’t claim to take anything to be true”, and thus they agree where it matters most to Fine.[^5]

## Appendix: Fine on Frede on belief

Although she ultimately rejects his view, Fine spends a great deal of time going over several ways to understand what Michael Frede thinks about belief. She does this, I think, for two reasons. First, he is an important voice in an ongoing debate, and so she wants to handle him charitably. Second, she wants to make sure that she doesn’t skim over or ignore something of philosophical value, even if it’s harder to see or less obvious.

[^1]: Fine leaves δόγμα, δόξα, and their cognates transliterated; she doesn’t translate them.

[^2]: In the light of work by Frede, Barney, and Morrison (among others?), I think that Fine’s approach is far too narrow. Unless we have a sense of the philosophical background for what Sextus says, we are likely to misunderstand it completely.

[^3]: See the citations in note 3, page 83.

[^4]: See page 86, where Fine worries that “if we expand the notion of belief beyong the limits of the standard view, to include every sort of acceptance attitude, we stretch the notion too far for it to be useful, thereby obscuring important distinctions.”

[^5]: Burnyeat and Frede disagree, of course, over whether the sceptic has beliefs, but that is only because they have different understandings of “belief”. Beneath that verbal disagreement, Fine locates a deeper agreement—an agreement that she will challenge in turn.
