### The Ten Modes

After she lays out the key arguments in each mode individually, Stough takes a step back in order to understand their shared structure and force. Stough provides two different ways of understanding the meta-argument of the modes, an A argument and a B argument. (Stough calls each of these a “schema” of the argument’s structure.) I’ll go through each of these here as well.

#### The A schema

> 1. The same objects appear different (different impresions are produced by the same objects) owing to differences in perceptual conditions.
> 2. [The real nature of an object is independent of perceptual conditions.]
> 3. We have no criterion to determine the accuracy of one perceptual experience (set of impressions) over another.
> 4. We can say how an object appears to us (describe our impressions), but not what it is in its real nature, i.e., we do not know the real nature of the object.
> (76)

Stough argues that “[b]y far the greatest attention of the Tropes is devoted to establishing the first premise” (76). The sceptics provide an enormous list of examples “to show that perceptual experiences can be made to vary as the relevant conditions under which perception takes place are altered” (76). Stough describes A1 as a factual claim, and she points out that except for the case of other animals in the firs trope, readers should be able to verify the factual claims themselves. In that sense, I suppose, the sceptics don’t take A1 to be controversial.

According to Stough, Sextus frequently mentions “the existence of conflicting opinions and beliefs”, but they are *not* “essential to the main argument” (77). In this way, the focus on conflicting beliefs is “misleading” (77). However, the attention that Sextus gives to such conflicts is also “instructive” since it reveals an assumption that “pervades the Tropes” (77). Here is that two-part assumption: (i) “different impressions...are produced by the same objects...owing to relevant differences of circumstance”; and (ii) “these different impressions generate different (and incompatible) beliefs about the same things, not all of which can be true” (77). The first part of this assumption *is* essentially A1; the second, however, is an additional step—and not strictly necessary.

Stough warns us to avoid two errors when thinking about conflicting beliefs in the modes. First, even though the last two modes focus far more on conflicting beliefs than earlier modes, the last two modes are not essentially different from the earlier ones. The other eight modes do mention conflicting opinions, and in all cases the presence or absence of conflicting opinions (as opposed to conflicting appearances) is not necessary for this argument schema. Stough also notes that the sceptics treat value judgments as essentially like perception: “To say, for example, that an object is beautiful is, in an important sense, like saying that it is rough or smooth” (77). Second, it is a good thing that the sceptical argument does not rely on conflicting appearances. It is not necessarily the case that conflicting beliefs always result from conflicts in appearances. The oar may seem bent in water and straight in the air, but a person might believe in both cases that the oar is straight. As Stough puts it, “To suppose that our beliefs are exact replicas of sensory experience is naïve; but the main argument of the Tropes...is independent of such a supposition” (78).

Finally, Stough also notes that we should not pay too much attention to sceptical discussion of varying (and sometimes conflicting) preferences and aversions. Like conflicting opinions, these can result from conflicting appearances, but they don’t necessarily do so. In addition, conflicting (or simply varying) preferences and aversions are not the best evidence for conflicting appearances. It is better to rely on “firsthand reports of percipients” when available, if we wish to establish that there are widespread differences in appearances.

Stough argues that although no source explicitly states A2 it “is assumed throughout” (79). She explains thus: “The implication here is that not all impressions of an object can be veridical” (79). Stough notes that it “would be contradictory to assert that the stick really is both straight and bent”, and she cites *PH* I 88 where Sextus argues as follows:

> ἤτοι γὰρ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις πιστεύσομεν ἢ τισίν. ἀλλ᾽εἰ μὲν πᾶσιν, καὶ ἀδυνάτοις ἐπιχειρήσομεν καὶ τὰ ἀντικείμενα παραδεξόμεθα
>
> For we will surely believe all people or some. But if (we believe) everyone, we will attempt the impossible and we will accept contradictions.[^1]

Stough doesn’t say so, but she seems to believe that we need something to get us from A1 to A3, and she supplies A2—which she takes to be assumed by the sceptics—to bridge this gap in the argument.

In A3, the sceptics argue that there is no clear way out of the problem. Each experience is “biased” in a sense, so no appearance can serve as a judge in cases of conflict. (Stough cites *PH* I 112-113, which is an especially clear version of this argument in Sextus.) Nor can reason do the job since “it has no direct access to the truth independent of sensory experience”. (Stough then cites *PH* I 128: “But neither does the mind [apprehend the real object] especially since its guides, which are the senses, go wrong.”)

Stough further argues that it’s not sufficient “to argue that...some conditions are accepted as stardard or normal” (80), and even more strongly she adds that this objection “does not meet Aenesidemus’ argument” (80). Stough points out that the debate is not over whether or not we consider some experiences or conditions “normal”, the debate is over whether or not any experiences or conditions reveal “the character of the external object” (80). If that is the sceptic’s challenge, it’s no good to cite some existing standard. After all, as Stough writes, “Any criterion selected from experience begs the very question at issue” (80).

Stough takes the conclusion—that we do not know the real nature of anything—to depend on a particular view of appearances, veridical appearances, and real objects. According to Stough a veridical experience “must reveal the object rather than its appearances” (81). In addition, an object’s true nature, the real object,

> is identical with some (unspecified) set of perceptible qualities, that is, some set of appearances (phenomena) or possible appearances. Alternately, to use the language of impressions, the real object consists of just those properties matched by some (correct) set of impressions (81).

According to Stough, Sextus suggests this view of what an object really is when he says that there is some “same x” although in one case “x appears F” and in another case “x appears F^”. Stough refers to several examples from Sextus where he describes the same water, honey, ship, and marble in a series of contrasting cases where each items appears different ways in different circumstances.[^2] Since (by A2) the object itself does not vary despite varying appearances, not all of these experiences can accurately represent their objects. However, (by A3) we lack an objective criterion to distinguish accurate from misleading impressions. But *some* impressions are accurate, and Stough explicitly identifies “not all impressions can represent the object accurately” with “not all phenomena can be identical with the object” (82). She also puts this positively: “some set of impressions reveals the nature of the object” is glossed in a parenthesis as “some set of appearances is identical with the object” (82).

Once she lays out the problem in these terms, Stough explains that the unknowability of objects is not simply a problem up to this point: objects are unknowable and this is “a matter of theoretical impossibility” (83). Here’s my reconstruction of what she has in mind:

1. A veridical (or “correct”) impression (or “appearance” or “phenomenon”) is identical with its object.
1. But all impressions are conditioned by its circumstances and the nature of the perceiver.
1. Thus, we are never in a position to compare an impression with its object. It is impossible to do so since there is no unconditioned impression of an object to compare specific impressions with.

That seems reasonable enough, but the actual principle that she offers as A2 worries me because it seems to be a fairly strong metaphysical claim or axiom. We can agree with Stough’s implicit point that something is needed to bridge A1 and A3, but we may disagree with the bridge she offers us. 

Perhaps, however, we can supply something less ambitious for A2. Why not simply “it is impossible that contradictory statements about an object are both true”? Or even less ambitious “it is impossible to accept contradictory statements”? (Notice that Sextus doesn’t say anything about truth or the state of the world. The only impossibility that he explicitly signals is that of accepting contradictories.) Or if we want to stay closer to Stough’s argument, perhaps “the real nature of an object cannot be contradictory”. But on the whole I’m not thrilled with giving the sceptics any premise that relies on such a dogmatic-seeming statement about the “real nature” of objects.

[A2 seems both too much and too little. It’s too much since a sceptic shouldn’t be making such extravagant metaphysical claims. And it’s too little since even if an object’s real nature is independent of its appearances, what does that tell us about those appearances?

If we want to get from A1 to A3, can we assume a background assumption that how things appear reflects how they are? If so, then if appearances vary, this alone will open up a gap between appearance and reality that may seem impossible to bridge.]

A3 and A4 are more straightforward. The lack of a criterion results because no appearance has any more claim to correctness than any other. Stough argues that there is no point saying that we give more credence to, say, waking appearances or appearances in good light.

[^1]: I’m not sure if “contradictory” is the best way to translate or understand ἀκτικείμενα here. Red and blue may conflict, as applied to one object in one sense, but they’re not really contradictory. So perhaps “opposed” or “conflicting” would work better. In addition, maybe the last καί is epexegetical. In that case, the last bit should be “we will attempt the impossible: i.e., we will accept opposed (things or appearances).
