# Notes on Pyrrho and Plato

If Bett is right, then Pyrrho starts from an assumption of radical flux. We might wonder how to make this coincide with the evidence that Pyrrho focuses on good and bad. However, note that Plato makes a similar conflation in *Theaetetus*. When Socrates first expounds the flux theory to Theaetetus, he focuses on perception, being, and becoming. Everything he talks about concerns sensibles and objects in the world. And then, suddenly, after he has asked Theaetetus to say what he makes of this flux theory, Socrates says Λέγε τοίνυν πάλιν εἴ σοι ἀρέσκει τὸ μή τι εἶναι ἀλλὰ γίγνεσθαι ἀεὶ ἀγαθὸν καὶ καλὸν καὶ πάντα ἃ ἄρτι διῇμεν (157d7-9).

+ Cambell notes the way these “are brought in as it were accidentally, merely as a fresh example” (63). But, in fact, he thinks this is a subtle tip-off to readers of Plato who will know that this means Plato will reject all of this as false—given his absolutism about good and bad?
+ Chappell says nothing about this.

Should we believe the stories that Diogenes Laertius and others tell about Pyrrho’s behavior? Probably not, and here are some reasons why not:

+ Other sources in Diogenes say otherwise.
+ See Plato’s *Theaetetus* on the life of philosophers versus the life of other people.
