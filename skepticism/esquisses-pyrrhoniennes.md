# Sextus Empiricus: Esquisses pyrrhoniennes (Pierre Pellegrin)

Pellegrin (hereafter “P”) begins by quoting Richard Popkin, who claims that Sextus Empiricus is “an obscure and unoriginal Hellenistic author about whom we known nearly nothing” (9). P means to challenge this view. He begins with the standard overview of the work and life of Sextus:

+ Sextus was probably alive in the 2nd or 3rd century ce.
+ Diogenes Laertius mentions him as almost the last representative of skepticism.
+ Sextus tells us that he was a doctor.
+ We have three works by Sextus: (i) the *Pyrrhonian Outlines*, (ii) the five books against logic, physics, and ethics, and (iii) the six books against specific sciences.

P breaks with the consensus view over one key point: he believes that the *Outlines* were written *after* not before the other works. He offers two main arguments for this view (12):

1. Key sections of the *Outlines* are more developed or philosophically more sophisticated than their equivalent in the other works. P gives the example of the attack Sextus makes on proof. P cites Brunschwig approvingly in support of this view.
1. Book I of the *Outlines* presents a unified overview of skepticism, but the other works have no such unified presentation. Instead, they have some of the same material but scattered about.

I think that the first point is strong but subjective. It probably won’t settle the matter for many people. I don’t find the second argument very convincing. You can easily argue that such a grand overview of skepticism, as such, doesn’t fit those other books—all of which are more topical.

Next P makes a roundabout argument that we should place Sextus relatively early in the 2nd century. First, P accepts the arguments of Ilsetraut Hadot dating the development of the trivium to the 2nd century CE (contra Henri-Irénée Marrou, who dates the trivium and quadivium all the way back to the 1st century CE) (13). On the basis of this, P argues that we can see here an argument for keeping Sextus’s dates *before* this development since Sextus always uses the earlier terminology for the sciences (ἐγκύκλια μαθήματα) rather than the new division and terminology (13). P acknowledges that Sextus does not need to discuss the new sciences or their division when responding to Stoics since the Stoics were relatively slow to take up the new terminology and Sextus primarily attacks much older Stoics (e.g., Zeno and Chrysippus). But nevertheless he argues that Sextus “could not have been silent about such an important distinction (the trivium and quadrivium)” if he had known about it (14).
