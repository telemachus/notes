# Some notes on irony in Plato's dialogues

## Words and concepts

The ancient Greek εἰρωνεία normally means something like 'deception'.  Modern irony tends to mean 'saying one thing but meaning another thing (often the opposite of what is said)'. In addition, in modern irony, the speaker (normally) *wants* the listener (or at least some part of the audience) to grasp the real meaning. Hence, irony and εἰρωνεία don’t normally refer to the same concept.

But even if the two words don't *normally* refer to the same concept, that doesn't mean that they *never* do so. The problem remains: Is Socrates ever ironic in our sense? Is Socratic εἰρωνεία always deceptive?

## Whose irony?

We should distinguish between irony that comes from Socrates the character and irony that comes from Plato the author. In the first case, Socrates himself, the character, intends to convey some indirect message via his words. We need to ask who the intended target is. In the second case, Plato speaks through the characters to his readers. Platonic irony is therefore a form of dramatic irony: author and audience know more than the characters.

## Deception and sincerity

Some scholars don't like the idea that Socrates deceives, but how much should that bother us? If we are not already Kantians about deception, it may not matter so much to us that Socrates sometimes lies or tries to deceive his interlocutors. Even more importantly--and even if we are Kantians--maybe Socrates lies and deceives, no matter what we prefer.
