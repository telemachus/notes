It would be difficult to overstate how much work it takes to treat Socrates
and Plato like "normal" philosophers. And that's not even the <i>really</i>
shocking thing. The really shocking thing is that most of the time we don't
even notice how far outside of normal the two of them are as philosophers
because other people have already done the work for us, and we simply take
their results for granted. Although I have serious reservations about
Christopher Warne's <i>Arguing with Socrates</i>, I want to start by
commending it for not completely glossing over the problems we face if we
want to talk about Socrates (and Plato) as part of the history of
philosophy.

Let me start by briefly explaining the abnormality of Socrates and Plato.
Socrates, and this is well known, wrote no philosophy. As a result,
whatever philosophical views we attribute to him we get secondhand (at
bestâ€”though often not even that directly). The three best known sources,
Aristophanes, Plato and Xenophon, are respectively a comedian, a writer of
conversational dramas and a historian. The picture we get of Socrates from
their works is, to put it mildly, very disparate. The character named
'Socrates' says wildly different things from author to author. Also, and
this is less often admitted, even within the works of one of these authors
Socrates contradicts himself frequently. Now as for Plato, I just described
him, unhelpfully, as a writer of conversational dramas. That was not
entirely serious. I don't actually know what to call the works of Plato.
Like many people, I'll usually write 'dialogues', but that's a bit of a cop
out. I do know, however, that they are not philosophy, as that word is
commonly used now. Certainly Plato's writings are filled with arguments,
and the characters in his works talk constantly about topics that are
central to philosophy: ethics, metaphysics, epistemology. But so are the
works of Kafka or Borges or Dostoyevsky. And yet, we all know that Plato is
a philosopher, while those other three wrote fiction. For the moment,
I don't want to challenge either categorization, but I do want to stress
that neither is obvious.

In the face of what I've described we have two choices, speaking very
generally. We can face the weirdness or we can ignore it. Most people,
honestly, ignore it. You can tell pretty easily when someone is ignoring
the peculiarity of Plato: they write things like "Plato says..." or "Plato
believes", and when you look up the reference, Socrates or Alcibiades or
Theaetetus will be speaking.[[1]] The same goes for Socrates, mutatis
mutandis, though in his case the problems are vastly magnified.

In order to make this more concrete, and before (finally) getting to the
book I'm supposed to be reviewing here, let me say a little about Plato's
<i>Laches</i>. In this dialogue two fathers, Lysimachus and Melesias, ask
two generals, Nicias and Laches, advice about whether or not to train their
sons in hoplite combat. Laches recommends inviting Socrates, who just
happens to be around, to join the discussion, and everyone readily agrees.
After a relatively long section of prepatory back and forth, the
philosophical topic of the dialogue emerges: What is courage? The generals
propose various answers, all of which Socrates knocks down. The dialogue
ends with Socrates promising to visit Lysimachus "tomorrow"[[2]] so that they
can look for a better teacher to help them all out.

The historical ironies of <i>these</i> men discussing <i>this</i> topic are
especially painful. The dramatic date is sometime between 424, when
Socrates and Laches fought together at the battle of Delium, and 418, when
Laches died at the battle of Mantinea. But the dialogue wasn't written or
made public until far later, at the earliest not until after 399, the year
that Socrates died. Within the dialogue, Nicias and Laches are
well-respected Athenian generals and Socrates is invited to join the
discussion since he takes a special interest in the education of young
people. For the reader, however, all of this is bitter in hindsight. Both
Laches and Nicias have lost their lives as commanders at battles that were
disastrous for the Athenians.[[3]] A jury of some 500 of Socrates's peers
has condemned him to death for "corrupting the young". Surely these can't
be the best experts on military education, courage and how to raise young
men?

But these sorts of historical ironies, and they are <i>everywhere</i> in
Plato's dialogues, are nearly impossible to apply philosophically. That is,
we can talk more or less vaguely about suggestions, tone, foreboding,
foreshadowing or pathos, but how exactly are we to turn any of this into
a premise in an argument? It is perhaps for this reason that so many
philosophers simply ignore the dramatic elements of the dialogues. There's
no clear way to turn these sorts of features into arguments. And arguments
are what philosophy demands.

So what's all this got to do with Warne's new book? (Circle back. Review
the book: good on dialectical introduction to arguments; very poor on
history; only so-so on deeper interaction of drama and philosophy.)

[[1]] Let me stress that I am not belittling this approach. I think that it
has been enormously fruitful. And in fact at least one author has used this
very productivity as an argument on behalf of reading Plato's dialogues in
a "doctrinal" manner. Terrence Irwin, in the preface to <i>Plato's
Ethics</i>, suggests that "a doctrinal approach will be most convincing if
it allows us to attribute a significant philosophical position to Plato"
(viii). In effect, the proof is in the eating. I think this argument, as
well as the doctrinal approach to Plato, has a great deal in its favor. My
point here, however, is that we can be misled into thinking that such an
approach is the <i>default</i> when it is anything but.

[[2]] Promises like this of more discussion "later" or "tomorrow" often
appear in Platonic dialogues. Like the promised poems of lyric poets,
tomorrow never comes. (Cf. Elroy Bundy <i>Studia Pindarica</i>, 21.) It
appears to be a literary device in Plato: a way for him to highlight the
incompleteness or failure of present arguments perhaps?

the Sicilian Expedition.
