# *Morality*, Bernard Williams

## Chapter 1: The Amoralist

In this chapter, Williams argues that the amoralist may not be a significant
problem for ethics.  His main argument is interesting in its own right, and
Williams also makes many useful observations along the way.

To begin with, Williams imagines someone asking the question "Why should I do
anything?"  As Williams says, someone may mean many things by this question,
but Williams considers two meanings here.  First, a person might ask the
question out of despair.  Second, someone might ask the question as
a challenge to morality.

In the case of despair, the person is asking "Why should I do anything?"
because they see the world as hopeless or meaningless or too painful to
endure.  Williams says, first, that we should not expect to be able to argue
such a person into hope.  We may talk to the person and lead them to be more
hopeful, but "that is not inducing [them] to care by reasoning, and it is very
doubtful whether there could be any such thing" (3).  Second, Williams says
that we should not consider such a person "as a defeat for reason or
rationality" (4).  Instead, such a person is "a defeat for humanity" (4).  In
a nutshell, we may wish that the world had more hope to offer such people, but
we should never have expected reason to be able to give remove despair.

The second person Williams considers is the amoralist.  Such a person
challenges morality when they ask "Why should I do anything?"  When they ask
the question, they are implicitly denying the reality or the necessity of any
*should* or *ought*.  They are denying the reality of necessity of morality,
at least for themselves.

Thus, the amoralist certainly challenges morality, but does the existence of
an amoralist defeat morality?  If such a person is real—or even possible—does
that show that morality is somehow bunk or impotent?  Williams is cagey, but
I think that his answer is "Yes and no."  Yes, morality cannot literally force
an amoralist to come around, not even if the amoralist is fully, even ideally,
rational.  No, because the amoralist is parasitical on the moral system and
because unless the person is pathological, they will have some concern for
others.  If they have some concern for others, then they have at least the
beginnings of what might become moral concern.  Nevertheless, we may not be
able to lead them significantly into morality, even if they are rational.

In order to understand the amoralist, Williams imagines motivations such
a person can or cannot have while remaining amoral.  The person can care about
things—they are not like the despairing and hopeless person.  They may care
about pleasure, power, or random (non-moral) things such as "some passion for
collecting things" (4).  However, they cannot have specifically moral
motivations.  Williams lists several of those: (i) they cannot care "about
other people's interests," (ii) they cannot have "any inclination to tell the
truth or keep promises if it does not suit [them] to do so," (iii) they cannot
"reject courses of action on the ground that they are unfair or dishonourable
or selfish" (4).  In addition, (iv) our amoralist (perhaps?) should not have
"any disposition...to stand back and have the thought that if it is 'all
right' for [them] to act in these ways, it must be 'all right' for others to
act similarly against [them].  For if [they are] prepared to take this stance,
we might be able to take a step towards saying that [they were] not a [person]
without a morality, but a [person] with a peculiar one" (5).

Williams distinguishes between (i)-(iii) and (iv) by calling (iv) "a more
formal aspect of morality" (5).  I suppose that he considers (i)-(iii)
substantive or first-order and (iv) a meta-ethical or second-order ethical
principle.  However, Williams does not go into detail.

In addition, Williams notes that the amoralist can say it's all right for
others to do this or that if by *all right*, the amoralist means "I'm not
going to moralize about it" (5)  What the amoralist cannot say (on pain of
contradiction or on pain of becoming moral) is that this or that is
"permitted" (5).  Along the same lines, Williams adds that the amoralist can
object or dislike people treating them in various ways if that means the
amoralist doesn't like the treatment or pushes back against it.  But the
amoralist cannot consistently resent or disapprove of treatment "for these are
attitudes within the moral system" (5).

Next, Williams adds other views that the amoralist must avoid to maintain
internal consistency.  First, as Williams already hinted, the amoralist cannot
say that others have "*no right* to dislike [them]" (6).  The amoralist must
also avoid a more subtle inconsistency: they should not believe that they are
somehow better in comparison to others in their society.  Williams especially
says that they should not think of themselves as braver than the ordinary and
fearful people who live moral lives.  (We could call this the *Nietzsche
mistake*.)  Why shouldn't the amoralist think he's better or braver?

> For in entertaining such thoughts, [they] will run a constant danger of
> getting outside the world of [their] own desires and tastes and into the
> region in which certain dispositions are regarded as excellent for human
> beings to have, or good to have in society, or such things; and while such
> thoughts need not lead directly to moral considerations, they give
> a substantial footing to them, since they immediate invite questions about
> what is so good about these dispositions, and it will be difficult for [the
> amoralist] to pursue those questions very far without thinking in terms of
> the *general* interests and needs of [their] fellow human beings, which
> would land [them] once more back in the world of moral thought from which
> [they are] excluded [themselves] (6-7).

Williams adds an argument that the amoralist makes a factual mistake if they
believe that "the more moral citizens wold be amoral if they could get away
with it, or if they were not too frightened, or if they were not passively
conditioned by society — if, in general, they did not suffer from inhibitions"
(7).  This leads Williams to something that I am very curious about right now:
how much should we care that our moral dispositions are the result of our
upbringing?  Williams distinguishes between two ways that the amoralist can
make their case.  If the amoralist claims that people would commit crimes if
they were sure that they would get away with it, Williams insists that the
claim is "absurd" (7).  As Williams insists, "The effects of moral education
can actually be to make people *want* to act, quite often, in
a non-self-interested way, and it often succeeds in making it at least quite
difficult, for internal reasons, to behave appallingly" (7-8).

At this point, Williams responds to the objection "But this...is just social
conditioning; remove that, and you will find no moral motivations" (8).
First, Williams responds, we should "reject the rhetoric of the word
'conditioning'" (8).  We need not believe that people are conditioned in the
sense that they are trained into unthinking, reflexive behavior.  People can
be thoughtful, and as Williams says, "insightful" agents (8).  Williams
continues:

> Then let us say instead that all moral motivation is the product of social
> influences, teaching, culture, etc.  It is no doubt true.  But virtually
> everything else about a [person] is such a product, including [their]
> language, [their] methods of thought, [their] tastes, and even [their]
> emotions, including most of the dispositions that the amoralist sets store
> by (8).

In this passage, William appears to confidently dismiss any concern that
features of our psychology are not *really us* if they are the result of our
culture and upbringing.  He seems not to worry that we might be radically
different if we were brought up somewhere else, or sometime else, or even just
by very different parents.  He appears to respond, "Of course you might be
very different, but those would be very different circumstances. What else
would you expect?"

Williams also makes quick work of arguments to the effect that we should care
most of all about *basic* or *primitive* elements in our psychology.  For
example, even if it were true that we were genetically selfish or that "very
small children" are selfish, so what?  Why should genetics or very small
children be the test of anything?  Nor does Williams grant that we should
decide what people are really like based on how they behave in terrible
conditions (e.g., conflict or grave scarcity).  As Williams says, "Conditions
of great stress and deprivation are not the conditions for observing the
typical behaviour of any animal nor for observing other characteristics of
human beings. If someone says that if you want to see what [people] are
*really* like, see them after they have been three weeks in a lifeboat, it is
unclear why that is any better a maxim with regard to their motivations than
it is with regard to their physical condition" (9).

At this point, Williams is ready to ask a key question: is the amoralist, as
described so far, "recognizably human" (9)?  In response, Williams insists
that the amoralist has to care about some people, has to be affected by the
"sufferings or distress" of someone (9).  If not, then the amoralist is,
according to Williams, a "psychopath" (9-10).  We cannot reason a psychopath
into becoming moral, but this is no surprise and not a point against morality.
If the amoralist matters, then that's "because [they] seemed to provide an
alternative; [their] life, after all, seemed to have its attractions" (10).
That isn't the case for someone with no feelings or sympathy for any other
person.  Thus, the amoralist must have some feelings or sympathy for other
people—or we can set them aside.

Williams imagines an amoralist along the lines of "[s]ome stereotype from
a gangster movie" (10).  This amoralist cares about some people (maybe
a parent, romantic partner, or child), and they sometimes act out of kindness
or consideration for others, though only if they feel like it.  According to
Williams, you probably couldn't argue such a person into being moral.  They
are unlikely to listen to your arguments, for example.  However, we can still
use them as a figure to consider.  How close or how far are they from
morality?

According to Williams, they are close insofar as they have already dipped
their toe into the beginnings of morality: they have some genuine concern for
others.  It would take a great deal, perhaps, to expand this little bit of
concern into something we would call full-blown morality, but Williams thinks
that other-concern is the necessary beginning.  As Williams explains:

> this [person] is capable of thinking in terms of others' interests, and
> [their] failure to be a moral agent lies (partly) in the fact that [they
> are] only intermittently and capriciously disposed to do so.  But there is
> no bottomless gulf between this state and the basic dispositions of
> morality.  There are people who need help who are not people who at the
> moment [the amoralist] happens to want to help, or likes; and there are
> other people who like and want other particular people in need. To get [the
> amoralist] to consider their situation seems rather an extension of [their]
> imagination and [their] understanding, than a discontinuous step onto
> something quite different, the 'moral plane'. And if we could get [the
> amoralist] to consider their situation, in the sense of thinking about it
> and imagining it, [they] might conceivably start to show some consideration
> for it: we extend [the amoralist's] sympathies. And if we can get [the
> amoralist] to extend [their] sympathies to less immediate persons who need
> help, we might be able to do it for less immediate persons whose interests
> have been violated, and so get [the amoralist] to have some primitive grasp
> on notions of fairness. If we can get [the amoralist] all this way, then,
> while [the amoralist] has no doubt an extremely shaky hold on moral
> considerations, [the amoralist] has some hold on them; at any rate, [they
> are] not the amoralist we started with (11-12).

Williams concludes by making two things clear.  First, he does not believe
that we can "sketch the...construction of the whole of morality from the
possibility of sympathy and the extensions of sympathy" (12).  Sympathy can
only get us in the door, but a fuller morality requires more than sympathy.
Second, that if the amoralist has some concern for other people—that is, if
the amoralist is not a psychopath, in Williams's sense—then they have an
essential element in any morality. As Williams continues, if we imagine
a person:

> with even a minimal concern for others, then we do not have to ascribe to
> [the amoralist] any fundamentally new kind of thought or experience to
> include [the amoralist] in the world of morality, but only what is
> recognizably an extension of what [the amoralist] already has.  [The
> amoralist] is not very far into it, and it is an extensive territory: as we
> saw in drawing up the amoralist, you have to travel quite a long way to get
> out of it.  But the person with the extended sympathies, the ability to
> think about the needs of people beyond [their] own immediate involvement, is
> recognizably in it (12).

Williams concludes this chapter with a disclaimer and an assertion.  Here is
the disclaimer: Williams knows that he has not proven (from what he said here)
that "having sympathetic concern for others is a necessary condition of being
in the world of morality, that the way sketched is the *only* way 'into
morality'" (12).  However, Williams asserts, "It does not follow from what has
so far been said; but it is true" (12).
