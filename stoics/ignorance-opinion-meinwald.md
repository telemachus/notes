# “Ignorance and Opinion in Stoic Epistemology” Constance Meinwald, *Phronesis*, 50, No. 3 (2005), 215-231

1. Stoic epistemology makes a clear contrast between sages and fools. Sages are
   wise: (i) they have ἐπιστήμη, and (ii) they never make mistakes. Fools are
   ignorant: (i) although they have some kataleptic impressions, (ii) their
   overall failures undermine even those occasional cases where they are
   correct, and for the right reasons, (iii) so that their ignorance is
   complete.
2. Fools are not examples of “idealized ignorance,” and they are not
   “symmetrically counterpoised” to sages. That is, fools are not (all) as
   ignorant as possible. Sages have all the wisdom, but fools occupy all the
   other “cognitive achievement space.”
3. We see something similar in Plato. The Socratic elenchus shows inconsistency,
   but it doesn’t tell us which views are false. Nevertheless, it removes any
   claim to expertise or knowledge.
4. Stoic ethics is equally stark: any amount of vice is complete vice, however
   close to virtue you are.
5. In Stoic ethics, everything remains “clear-cut and striking,” but in
   “detailed work on Stoic epistemology itself” we often find that interpreters
   “lose the starkness and clarity native to Stoicism” (216).
6. Annas is a special offender for Meinwald. In particular, Meinwald focuses on
   the series Annas gives of “forms of acceptance” (217): συγκατάθεσις, δόξα,
   κατάληψις, ἐπιστήμη. Annas does not say how she arrived at this ordering, but
   Meinwald guesses that Annas did so by mixing and matching testimony from
   Cicero and Sextus.

        Cicero: φαντασία, συγκατάθεσις, κατάληψις, ἐπιστήμη (Ac. 2.145 = SVF
        1.66).
        Sextus: κατάληψις is between ἐπιστήμη and δόξα (M 7.151).

   Meinwald stresses that neither source tells us to put δόξα “higher than mere
   assent” (217). Meinwald suggests two questions here. First, what would assent
   weaker than δόξα “possibly be” (217-218) for the Stoics? Second, is ignorance
   (ἄγνοια, inscientia) “better than” (218) δόξα? Or, more generally, how are
   ignorance and δόξα related?
7. Meinwald sets out to clarify δόξα in Stoic epistemology. She will argue,
   first, that there is no assent lower than δόξα and, second, that ignorance is
   no better than δόξα. For Meinwald, both ἐπιστήμη and δόξα are equally
   assents. In “the best case” the assent is (part of?)^ opinion and (part of?)^
   ignorance (218).
   Meinwald begins with “the comparatively uncontroversial notion of knowledge
   and ignorance” (218). She argues that (i) κατάληψις cannot be wrong, (ii)
   ἐπιστήμη is “unshakeably secure assent to καταληπτικὴ φαντασία, and (iii)
   “anything less is ignorance” (219).
   Meinwald argues next that “opinion and ignorance are equivalent notions in
   Stoicism” (219). Cicero says that comphrehensio (= κατάληψις) is between
   knowledge and ignorance (Ac. 1.42 = SVF 1.60 = LS 41B), while Sextus places
   belief (δόξα, opinio) between knowledge and ignorance (M. 7.151 = LS 41C).
   Meinwald claims that this gives us good reason to identify belief and
   ignorance, though she acknowledges that we must still explain *how* κατάληψις
   lies between knowledge and belief/ignorance.
   Even further, she argues that “for the most clear-cut view each of these
   forms of commitment would be made of eponymous parts” (219). Knowledge is
   made up of pieces of knowledge, and opinion = ignorance is made up of pieces
   of opinion.^ This gives us a result that is simple (in a good way), and the
   result agrees with (early?) Platonic Socrates and the *Republic*.
   Next Meinwald explains a problem for the view of Annas and LS that
   “individual opinion” is “assent to incognitive impression” (220). If this is
   correct, then either (i) the state of opinion is not made up wholly of
   individual opinions or (ii) opinion is not ignorance. Ignorance certainly
   includes more than assent to incognitive impressions. Weak assen to cognitive
   impressions is also (part of) ignorance.
   Meinwald notes that W. Görler takes option (i) above while Annas and LS, as
   well as many others, take option (ii). Nevertheless, both Annas and LS
   acknowledge “some evidence that some Stoics failed to distinguish between, or
   indeed actually identified, doxa and ignorance” (221, where Meinwald refers
   to Annas 187 and LS I.258).
