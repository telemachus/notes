# The big picture

If I use the fall (Lucretius) to discuss (i) Presocratics, (ii) Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and (iii) the Hellenistic schools and then I use the spring (Descartes) to discuss (i) late ancient, (ii) medieval, and (iii) early modern philosophy and I include *a little* contemporary material in both semesters, then I get a history of philosophy in the year.

One job for the summer: plan this out more fully.

## Presocratics

### Milesians

Not sure, but basically: what even is monism? Clarify that they are not saying that everything is (literally) *one thing*, but rather that perhaps one thing is primary in some physical, logical, or explanatory sense. Thus, it is an ἀρχή.

### Heraclitus versus Parmenides

Contrast these two as opposite sides of the same coin? Heraclitus argues that the apparent stability of things is false: reality is ever-changing and without any stable unities. Parmenides argues that the apparent change of things is false: reality is singular and unchanging. Both views are challenging, both feel profound at first, and both are nearly impossible to spell out in any way that isn't nonsense.
