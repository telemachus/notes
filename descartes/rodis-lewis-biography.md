# Descartes: His Life and Thought, Geneviève Rodis-Lewis

## Prologue

RL starts with the celebrations for the *Discours* in 1937 and 1987. She notes that the *Discours* is meant for everyone, and she reminds us that Descartes chose French for this reason. She stresses that the autobiographical elements are used to help readers draw lessons for themselves rather than to teach readers about the life of Descartes.

> A biography of the philosopher should illuminate certain points that are properly historical and often poorly known, but it should also make every effort to approach his exceptional personality (viii).

RL recommends that we follows the advice Descartes gives readers in his *Principles of Philosophy*. First skim the book like a novel; then go back and rework particular parts if you have curiosity to do so (viii).

RL mentions several key areas of controversy for a life of Descartes. First, the status of his family and Descartes’ resistance to the law. Second, the dates when Descartes studied at La Flèche, how long he was at Poitiers---and what he studied there. The character of Descartes’ youth and the sincerity, depth, and nature of his religious belief.

## Descartes’s Biographers

+ Two short works in Latin soon after Descartes’ death: (i) Daniel Lipstorp and (ii) Pierre Borel. Lispstorp knew that Descartes was born at La Haye; Borel initially thought at Châtellerault, but he corrected himself in his second edition. Lipstorp exaggerates the nobility of the family; Borel places Descartes at all the major sieges of his time in the army. But they have some value.
+ Our principal source is Adrien Baillet. He published a number of texts that have since disappeared, though he often paraphrases them. Some doubt Baillet’s views on Descartes’ celibacy and piety because Baillet wrote lives of saints. RL criticizes Baillet (i) for mistakes about the dates at La Flèche, (ii) mistakes about what Descartes studied at Poitiers, (iii) wrongly believing that Descartes joined the military because his father wished it, as well as several other smaller matters.
+ Adam, in the Adam and Tannery edition, follows Baillet too naively.
+ The correct dates for Descartes schooling at La Flèche were 1607-1615. J. Sirven established this in 1928, and Gilson followed correctly.
+ Descartes said ‘Larvatus prodeo’: ‘I go forward wearing a mask’. Is this a reference to atheism? Was he a secret libertine?
+ RL says that modern works that question the Baillet view of Descartes as a secular saint matter: ‘Above all, they call for a new reflection on that man who wished to join the military to travel throughout Europe, before isolating himself in a solitude so complete that it is impossible to situate’ (xvi).
+ RL notes the joking nickname ‘D’Escartes’ before ending with the observation that in the winter of 1619-1620, he decided to devote his life to advancing in knowledge of truth and at the end of his life ‘advancing in the search for truth’ remained ‘the principal good in this life’ for Descartes (xvi-xvii).

## Family and Childhood

René Descartes was born in La Haye, Touraine, on March 31, 1596. His father was Joachim Descartes, probably the son of Pierre Descartes, a doctor from Châtellerault in Poitou. The grandfather was not a member of the nobility, which was rare for doctors. However, a road to the nobility was the practice of law, especially if this practice continued for three generations. Joachim pursued this road, working first in Paris and then as a counselor at the Parliament of Brittany. He wanted his sons and grandsons to be lawyers as well in order to enoble the family. His family received a first degree of nobility only in 1668. Descartes mother was Jeanne, née Broachard, and the home of his mother’s family was also in Châtellerault.

Descartes had an older brother, Pierre, and and older sister, Jeanne. Pierre left for La Flèche in 1604 when the school opened. Jeanne remained at their grandmother’s house until the grandmother died in 1610. Their mother died in May of 1597 after giving birth to a son who died three days later. However, Descartes seems not to have known these facts. In a letter to Princess Elizabeth, Descartes wrote that his mother died after complications from *his* birth.

As a child Descartes was sickly. He might have started at La Flèche in 1604 as well, but they waited until 1607 to send him. After the death of their mother, Joachim remarried, set up a house in Rennes and had another son and daughter. Jeanne moved there after the death of their grandmother in 1610. René got along well with the sister and her husband, remaining friendly with his brother-in-law even after the death of his sister. However, he did not get along well with his brother Pierre.
