+ Epicurus appeals to contemporary philosophers, in part, because he believes
  that death is annihilation. Thus he “frees the discussion from any untoward
  theological constraints” (200).
+ Phil claims that “the ancient Epicureans are typically given either too much
  or too little credit for their views” (201).
+ Phil wants to place the views of Epicurus and the Epicureans where they
  belong, “a particular historical context and…a particular vision of a good
  life that is often remote from contemporary preoccupations” (201).
+ Phil identifies two primary sources of potential confusion. First, Epicurus
  was far from alone in arguing that death does not harm some lives. This view
  was common among many ancient philosophers. (E.g., Socrates, Plato, the
  Stoics, and more.) Second, although Epicurus was a hedonist, his version of
  hedonism does not lead to worries about deprivation after death. By contrast,
  contemporary philosophers find these worries so obvious that they sometimes
  assume Epicurus and Epicureans are being perverse in denying them.
+ Epicurus and Epicureans, according to Phil, focus almost entirely on “the
  exemplary wise” person (202). As such, they are not especially worried by the
  thought that death might rob people of potential goods. The wise person is
  already in full possession of all the goods that life has to offer—at every
  moment, their life is complete and perfect. As Phil reminds readers, Lucretius
  says that most people are better off dying soon since they have nothing to
  look forward to other than more of the same misery (202, *DRN* 3.940-944).
+ “The Epicureans are thorough rationalists and believe that once someone comes
  to understand the truth of a proposition such as ‘death does no harm,’ one’s
  emotional states will follow suit and one’s fear of death will disappear”
  (213). See also, “One does not ascend the ladder to Epicurean perfection by
  means of one’s emotional states, but by rational arguments” (213).
