# Les atomistes de l’antiquité: Démocrite, Épicure, Lucrèce (Jean Salem)

## Leucippe et Démocrite

Salem won’t go as far as Epicurus, who said that Leucippus did not exist, but he does think that we can leave Leucippus almost entirely on the sidelines while talking about Democritus. He chooses to mention Leucippus only in passing, when the testimony about him is relevant to whatever Salem is saying about Democritus.

Salem notes that we have three possible birthdates for Democritus: 460 (10 years later than Socrates), 470 or 469 (a year before Socrates), or 494 (roughly 30 years before Socrates). He goes with the latest date, 460. This means that Democritus was born, according to Salem, around ten years later than Socrates.

Salem proposes four main sources that we should consider in order to understand Democritus:
1. the fragments in Diels-Kranz and Luria;
2. the works of Aristotle, who often has Democritus in mind even if he does not name him;
3. the Hippocratic corpus;
4. scholarly literature about Democritus over the last hundred years or so.

Salem arranges his coverage of Democritus into eight areas:
1. general atomic principles;
2. details of astronomy and meteorology;
3. epistemology;
4. theory of the soul and psychology;
5. living creatures, theory of generation in the medical corpus and Aristotle;
6. anthropology;
7. ethics;
8. the legends and false stories that accumulated around Democritus in the ancient tradition.

### Physique Générale

Salem begins with another analogy for atomism: letters. Atomists believed that the differences between atomic compounds depend on the differences of the order and positions of atoms that make up the compounds. To help explain this, Salem refers to letters. Atoms differ in shape, as A differs from N. Atoms differ in order, as AN differs from NA. And atoms differ in position as Z differs from N. (This last example is not exact, and Salem uses a slightly differnt example, but you get the idea.)

Salem is at pains to emphasize the empirical character of Democritean atomist. He vigorously denies that atomism is merely a logical reaction to Parmenides and Zeno. Likewise, he insists that when the atomists argue for void, the claim that movement exists is “expérimentale.” However, what he means here by “experiemental” is not entirely clear to me. He doens’t seem to mean that these atomists conducted actual experiments. He seems, rather, to mean “experiential.” So, for example, immediately after he first says that the atomists rely “sur une constatation *expérimentale*” (28, his emphasis), he writes, “laquelle constatation dérive d’une information qui nous est fournie et sans cesse confirmée par les *sens*” (28, his emphasis).
