# Overview of the second meditation

1. Recap and the search for an Archimedean point.
2. Perhaps the only certainty is that nothing is certain.
3. A necessary truth: I exist as long as I am thinking.
4. In order to know what I am I’ll remove everything doubtful.
5. I think that I’m a person, but that doesn’t get me very far.
6. I am a real (true?) thing insofar as I exist. I am a thinking thing.
7. I won’t focus on the traditional view that I’m a sould joined to a body.
8. Thinking means doubting, understanding, affirming, denying, wishing, refusing, imagining, and perceiving.
9. Even if the content of my thoughts is false, it remains true that I’m thinking those thoughts.
10. I am a thinking thing, but it still seems as though physical things are better known than this thinking I.
11. For example, this piece of wax. I easily perceive various properties, but those properties can change though the wax itself remains the same thing.
12. But, in fact, the actual grasp that I have of th wax is not sensory but intellectual.
13. It’s easy to fall back into old habits and think that my perception is via sensation not thought. But in fact my sensory information always underdetermines my thoughts.
14. On consideration I definitely perceive the wax better through intellect than through my sneses.
15. I perceive my mind far more clearly than anything physical like the wax.
16. This settles the question I began with, but habit is hard to break so I’ll pause here.
