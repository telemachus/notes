# Descartes and Ancient Skepticism: Reheated Cabbage?

(Gail Fine, Philosophical Review, Volume 109, Number 2 (April 2000), 195-234)

## Introduction

Recent commentators argue that “there are significant differences between ancient and modern skepticisism”, and Fine will consider this view with a critical eye. By “modern”, people usually mean “Cartesian and post-Cartesian” skepticism. The differences include the following:
+ Ancient skeptics disavow belief while modern skeptics disavow only knowledge (195, note 1).
+ Ancient skeptics have a narrower scope than moderns. Ancient skeptics, for example, do not question “whether they have bodies or whether there is an external world” (196). They ask whether, for example, honey is sweet, but they do not ask whether honey exists. Fine calls this “property skepticism” (196).
+ Ancient skepticism is a way of life, but modern skepticism is (merely) academic of “methodological”.
Fine notes that some people explain the second difference by means of the third. Since skepticism was part of ordinary life for ancient skeptics, they would not have (could not have?) engaged in challenges that would upend their lives (196-197).

Fine claims that although several scholars have written about how Descartes compares with ancient skepticism, no one has considered “Descartes’s own view of the matter”. That is what she proposes to do, by comparing Descartes with Pyrrhonian skepticism. (She explicitly sets aside Academic skepticism in this paper.) Fine also makes clear that by “Pyrrhonian skepticism”, she means Sextus Empiricus—and in particular book 1 of *Outlines of Pyrrhonism*.

Two additional pieces of pre-discussion clarification. First, Fine notes that “Descartes is *not* a skeptic” (198, emphasis in the original). So far from being a skeptic, Descartes claims to be the “first to have offered a satisfactory reply to skepticism”. Fine knows this very well, but will talk about Descartes’s skepticism and his skeptical phase to mean “the skeptical arguments described in, for example, Mediation 1” and his situation in “for example, Meditation 1”. Fine follows Williams view of this matter: Descartes uses skepticism in order to defeat skepticism, but we can still usefully talk about the skeptical arguments that he uses as “his” skepticism. Second, Fine acknowledges that we cannot know precisely what ancient skepticism Descartes read. He doesn’t ever discuss ancient skepticism in detail, nor does he say “what he read or when he read it”. He does speak of ancient skepticism sometimes, however, and he even distinguishes between “Academics and Skeptics”. We also have good reason to believe that he had a decent amount of indirect knowledge of Pyrrhonian skepticism via Montaigne and Charron. We know he read these authors, and they explicitly discuss Sextus. Additionally, Descartes was in frequent communication with Mersenne and others who explicitly discuss Sextus.

## Difference #2: Does Descartes introduce a wider scope for skepticism?

Fine takes up the second difference in her earlier list first. (She doesn’t explicitly flag this, and in addition she comes at the question somewhat obliquely. Nevertheless, it’s clear that this section ends with a discussion of property skepticism.)

Fine argues primarily on the basis of how Descartes viewed his own arguments. Descartes repeatedly claimed that his skeptical arguments were not new. For example, “I was not the first to discover such doubts: the sceptics have long been harping on this theme” (CSM 1:309, from *Comments on a Certain Broadsheet*).
