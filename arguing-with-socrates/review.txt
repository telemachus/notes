In his preface, Warne writes that he had a hard time finding secondary
literature on Plato that met his "needs as a second-year undergraduate"
(xi). In one sense, this is surely surprising since introductory works on
Plato have always been so numerous. But Warne goes on to make clear that he
wasn't looking for just any introductory book: "Frequently, arguments
appeared to ahve been plucked from dialogues and appraised with reference
to remarks in other dialogues, which left little sense of [the] whole from
which they were taken"[[1]] (xi). Apparently Warne didn't want just any
introduction to Plato and that the introduction he has written has
a specific aim. Although I have concerns about a number of Warne's choices,
overall this book does admirably succeed in its purpose of providing
stimulating introductions to the arguments of individual dialogues with
little or no reference to other works by Plato (much less other ancient
authors).

The book contains two sections of very unequal length. Part One, at 31
pages, includes two chapters: 'People' and 'How Socrates argues'. Part Two,
at 147 pages, includes nine chapters, each on a different Platonic
dialogue: <i>Apology</i>, <i>Crito</i>, <i>Hippias Major</i>, <i>Ion</i>,
<i>Laches</i>, <i>Meno</i>, <i>Protagoras</i> and <i>Symposium</i>.

The chapter on 'People' is unfortunately the weakest in the book. Perhaps
Warne is within his rights to say that he will not even try to discuss the
Socratic problem. Instead he proposes to discuss only Socrates the
character that appears in Plato's shorter dialogues.[[2]] However, this is
not what he actually does. Instead, he passes along unattributed ancient
gossip. For example, he writes that Socrates "possibly worked as a mason or
usurer." He does not say where this speculations come from. Once he opens
such doors, Warne owes it to his readers to cite references and to discuss,
at least briefly, the credibility or otherwise of our ancient sources. In
his very brief overview of Plato's life later in the same chapter, Warne
takes issue with a common portrait of Plato's career. He writes, "Pascal
confounded this picture of Plato the academic: 'We always picture Plato and
Aristotle wearing long academic gowns, but they were ordinary decent people
... who enjoyed a laugh with their friends ... if they wrote about politics
it was as if to lay down rules for a madhouse'."[[3]] I don't think I fully
understand what Pascal is getting at there, but much more importantly, how
could this vague, airy bit of Pascal possibly "confound" our understanding
of Plato's career? Pascal seems to be simply asserting his view of Plato
and Aristotle -- "ordinary decent people" -- and again Warne does not tell
the reader <i>why</i> this should move us. In sum, I would not recommend
students read this chapter, and I would likely warn them against taking it
at face value, in case they did decide to read it. It is unhelpful at best
and positively harmful at worst.
