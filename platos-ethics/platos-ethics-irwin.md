# Notes on *Plato's Ethics*, Terence Irwin

Irwin describes his own view, which he calls 'doctrinal' in the preface as
follows:

> My attempt to attribute an ethical theory to Plato may suggest to some
> readers that I have misconceived the character of the dialogues altogether.
> I have ascribed a relatively systematic body of doctrines to Plato on the
> strength of the dialogues; but some readers strongly reject this 'doctrinal'
> view of the dialogues.  I acknowledge an element of truth in those
> approaches that emphasize Plato's distance from the characters in his
> dialogues; still, I believe a doctrinal view is broadly correct, and that it
> finds strong support both in Aristotle's comments on Plato and in a fair
> and scrupulous examination of the dialogues.  It seems to me that
> a doctrinal approach will be most convincing if it allows us to attribute
> a significant philosophical position to Plato; and so my main aim is to
> describe the position that he holds (viii).

In the first chapter, Irwin contrasts his doctrinal view with what he calls an
'aporetic' view as follows:

> The doctrinal approach of Aristotle and (apparently) his contemporaries is
> not the only possible approach to the dialogues.  We might believe that the
> dialogues are primarily exploratory and that they expound and examine
> certain views that Plato thinks worth discussing, without necessarily
> committing himself to them.  If we accept this 'aporetic' approach, we will
> not insist that the position of the leading speaker in different dialogues
> must be consistent or that it must develop along lines that would be
> reasonable in the thought of a single person; 'Socrates' (and so on) may
> simply be the mouthpiece of views that Plato chooses to discuss at different
> times (6).

Irwin also describes what he calls an 'esoteric' view.  Briefly, this approach
to Plato tells us that "Plato writes the dialogues in the light of some views
that he does not express there" (6).

Irwin claims that Aristotle's approach "deserves to be our working hypothesis"
(6).  If we cannot make sense of the dialogues using this approach, then we
can change tack.

In addition, Irwin says that the doctrinal approach can borrow from other
views at times.  For example, perhaps Plato sometimes includes exploratory
material in his dialogues.  And sometimes, Plato may have in mind views that
he does not explicitly mention.  Thus, the doctrinal interpreter can make use
of aporetic and esoteric approaches when they help.

Irwin knows that some people use the dialogue form itself to argue against the
doctrinal method.  That is, some people argue that we can infer that Plato
does not want us to read his texts as *his views* simply because they are
dialogues.  According to Irwin, however, the dialogue form by itself "provides
no such evidence until we can rule out an explanation of Plato's choice of the
dialogue form that is consistent with a doctrinal interpretation."

Furthermore, Irwin believes that there was a valid reason for Plato to write
dialogues that does not require us to give up the doctrinal approach.  Irwin
argues that Plato wrote dialogues because he found dialectic, question and
answer, to be an essential part of philosophy.  Furthermore, Irwin thinks that
in Plato's dialogues Socrates uses question and answer as a secret weapon.  By
asking questions and getting interlocutors to put their own views up for
investigation, confirmation, and rejection, Socrates is able to convince
interlocutors of views that they never would have accepted if they merely read
them off in a book.

Irwin does not offer examples here, and I wonder which specific examples he
has in mind.  In several cases, the interlocutors seem largely untouched by
Socrates.  For example, Euthyphro and Ion do not appear to change their views
in any significant way.  They admit that they cannot answer Socrates in ways
that satisfy socrates, but this does not lead them to any insight.  At the end
of their respective dialogues, they walk away, and we have no reason to
believe that they are shaken in their views or likely to change their opinion
in the future after further thought.  In other cases, interlocutors grudgingly
admit defeat, but they too appear not to actually change their views.  For
example, Socrates drags Polus, Callicles, and Protagoras to grant Socrates key
premisesâ€”and sometimes even key conclusions. Nevertheless, they too seem to
resist real change of view.  The more I think about this, the more it bothers
me.
