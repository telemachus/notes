# *Descartesâ€™s Meditations: an introduction* Catherine Wilson (CUP; Cambridge, 2003)

## Introduction: About the *Meditations*

Wilson says that the *Meditations* are devoted to these questions:

1. What can we come to know about the human mind and its powers?
1. Is there a reality behind appearances, and, if so, how can we have access to it?
1. Do our experiences arise from our bodies and our brains, or could we think, feel, and perceive without them?
1. How can we recognize truth and distinguish it from false and confused opinion?
1. Is there a God, and, if so, is this God benevolent, malevolent, or simply indifferent to us?
1. If this God is benevolent, how should we understand illness, error, and morally wrong actions?

Wilson intends the book to be (i) an introduction to the *Meditations* themselves and (ii) an introduction to some basic philosophical problems and to analytical philosophy.
