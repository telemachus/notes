## Descartes’ changing reputation

+ 17th century: mathematics and cosmology
+ 18th century: away from cosmology and towards his mechanistic physiology, especially his theory of “animal machines”
+ 19th century, post-Kant: metaphysics and epistemology
+ 20th century Anglophone philosophy: skepticism and Descartes’s skeptically driven epistemology
+ 20th century French and German philosophy: “ethical and political consequences of Descartes’s idea of a self as independent of the world in which it finds itself, as a locus of subjectivity that is given prior to any interactions that it has with other subjects”. (I.e., phenomenology and existentialism à la Heidegger?)

Gaukroger says that all of these “themes can be found in Descartes” (3) and also that there is support for the 18th-century reading of him as a materialist and the 20th-century reading of him as a dualist. The best way to understand him overall is by looking at “the development of Descartes’s intellectual interests” (3).

## Early Life, 1596-1618

Gaukroger notes that the Jesuit schools of the 16th century like the one Descartes attended were all consuming: “holidays decreased from four weeks to one week a year as the child moved up the school” (4). He covers the basics of the curriculum as in Alquié, but with slightly different emphasis.

+ Five years for Latin, with a basic knowledge only for Greek, and a “wide range of classical texts, with Cicero predominating” (4).
+ Many students left after these five years.
+ Three more years for Christianized Aristotle: logic, natural philosophy, some elementary mathematics, metaphysics and ethics.
+ Theologically conentious tops “were generally avoided” (4).

One other note: Gaukroger goes with the theory that Descartes studied engineering when he was in the army.

## Apprenticeship with Beeckman, 1618-1619

Beeckman and Descartes met in 1618. Beeckman was eight years older than Descartes, and Descartes had never met anyone who studied physics and mathematics in tandem the way that Beeckmann did. According to Gaukroger, Beeckman “introduced Descartes to a quantitative micro-corpuscularian natural philosophy” (5).

Descartes’s earliest writings are from late 1618 and early 1619. He wrote a short work “on the mathematical basis of consonance in music” first. He also traded letters with Beeckman concerning free fall, and he and Beeckman worked together on several problems in hydrostatics. In the second and third cases, Descartes already shows a tendency that will grow in his work over time: he translates solved mathematical problems from a macroscopic point of view to questions at the microscopic level. In other words, we can see and measure how water behaves in various contexts, but Descartes goes on to ask what microscopic bodies would explain this visible behavior.

By the end of 1619, Descartes was working primarily on math problems. In particular, the proportional compass led him to wonder how arithmatic and geometry were connected. This in turn led him to create the idea of an algebraic universal mathematics. He used this algebraic method to solve various difficult mathematical problems, but he also began to wonder at an even *more* general method, a truly universal method (5-6).

## The *Regulae*, 1619-1628

The *Regulae* was not finished, but the plan was three parts, each of which would have twelve rules.

1. First set: general method, simple propositions and how they are known.
1. Second set: how to handle problems that are perfectly understood.
1. Third set: how to handle problems that are imperfectly understood.

He never wrote the third set, and I believe the second set was incomplete as well. Gaukroger also argues that Descartes changed his own view of the work after putting it aside for a time (6). He wrote rules 1-11 in 1619-1620. Then in 1626, he picked it upu again. He revised rules 4 and 8, wrote rules 12-18, and wrote titles for rules 19-21. He works on it until 1628. By the later period, Descartes is thinking very much in terms of optics and perceptual cognition, in addition to mathematics. In between 1626 and 1628 Descartes discovered the sine law of refraction while doing work on optics, lenses, and light. He also thought a great deal about perceptual cognition, while also wondering “whether there was a way of representing information in such a way that its truth or falsity would be immediately manifest” (7).

Descartes gave up on the *Regulae* when he realized that it wouldn’t cover all the cases he thought it should. He was able to figure out a way to represent the clear truth of some simple mathematical propositions (e.g., 3 + 3 = 6), but he could not extend this to reach more complex math (e.g., extraction of higher-order roots). Gaukroger claims that “this also marks the end of the attempt to model knowledge on mathematics, at least in anything other than a merely rhetorical sense” (7). Math remains a “paradigm of certainty” (7), but it doesn’t contribute substantively to answering how to derive certainty. (Gaukroger doesn’t mention, but I wonder about whether Descartes cooled on math once he decided that even 2 + 2 lacked the ultimate kind of certainty that he was seeking. That is, he argues that god might have created a world where 2 + 2 did not equal 4.)

## *Le Monde* and *L’Homme*, 1629-1633

Descartes moved to the netherlands in 1630, and he lived there for the next 20 years. From 1629, he was working on a grand project in three parts. *Le Monde* discusses inanimate nature; *L’Homme* discusses animan and human physical nature—everything non-conscious; and a third part would discuss consciousness and the rational soul. (The third part was never written.)

*Le Monde* represents the world as entirely made of matter. All matter is the same in type, but may very in size. Laws govern the movement of the particles of matter, and Descartes creates an entire “mechanistic cosmology” (8) on the basis of these principles.

Descartes denies the existence of empty space: “the universe is a plenum”. So he needs to expend a lot of effort to explain the laws governing the motion of matter. He also believes that god created the universe and imbued matter with various motions, but afterwards god does not intervene in the working of the world. After the start of the universe, three basic laws govern all motion:

1. A body stays in motion unless stopped or slowed by another body.
1. After a collision between bodies, the total amount of motion is conserved.
1. A body always tends to move in a rectilinear manner.

On the basis of these principles, Descartes sets out a heliocentric cosmology for a hypothetical “new world” (9). He explains motion via vortices since in “a plenum, for any part of it to move it is necessary that other parts of it move” (9).

Although we would reject nearly all of the details of his plan, Descartes does admirable work here. He strives to build a complete picture of inanimate nature from a few principles about matter, three laws of motion, and the idea of centrifugal force. In addition, he cares very much that his explanations be quantifiable, and he recognizes the validity of the heliocentric model of the universe.

If Descartes’s mechanical picture of the world was contentious, his application of mechanism to animals was far more radical (10). Descartes gives mechanistic explanations of digestion and the circulation of blood. He is aware of Harvey’s theory that the heart pumps blood, but he rejects it in favor of a view that the heart is like a small sun. The warmth of the heart causes the motion of blood throughout the body. Descartes also provides a theory of higher functions according to which “animal spirits” are carried in the blood and into the brain (via the pineal gland) (10-11). Descartes offers a theory of the nervous system and motion, as well as non-teleological accounts of the formation of the fetus and perception.

One important feature of Descartes’s physiology: he considers animals to be thoughtless automata. Thus, he needs an account of perception that is, in a sense, thoughtless. Animals and humans can share perception up to this point, but no further.

## Skeptically Driven Epistemology, 1633-1641

Descartes did not complete or release his physics because of the condemnation of Galileo in 1633. However, Descartes did salvage some of the work that he had done during this period. He exerpted three essays: on optics, meteorology, and geometry for publication. Nevertheless, the whole character of his work changes after the Church condemned Galileo.

As Gaukroger describes it, Descartes shifts from doing science pre-1633 to justifying and explaining how it is possible afterwards. In the *Discours* and the *Meditations*, Descartes attempts to provide knowledge that is immune to skeptical attack. In addition, Descartes provides a metaphysics that explains how this knowledge is possible. By doing all of this, Descartes supports his scientific work indirectly. If Gaukroger is correct, Descartes depicts a world “consisting in nothing but geometrically quantifiable extension”. Such a world is only compatible with mechanism, and if we grant Descartes a few more principles, we arrive back at his heliocentric universe of *Le Monde* (12-13).

## A System of Philosophy, 1641-1644

After a few years fighting off the attacks of a Dutch theologian Gisbert Voetius, Descartes begins writing his *Principia*. The *Principia* provide a kind of synthesis of the natural science of *Le Monde* with the skeptically-driven metaphysics of the *Meditations*. Descartes insists, however, that the science alone is incomplete. When his follower Regius prints an account of Cartesian natural science without the metaphysics, Descartes attacked him in turn. Only if we have a clear grasp of the metaphysics can our science be correct.

## The Passions of the Soul, 1643-1650

In 1643 Descartes started a fruitful correspondance with Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia. Elizabeth asked Descartes many probing questions, particularly about the passions. She raised issues about the connection between the mind and the body in Descartes’s account. This correspondence (in part?) led to Descartes writing *The Passions of the Soul* to clarify his views. In this work, he argues for a three-part distinction between (i) the mind alone, (ii) the body alone, and (iii) an embodied mind. In practice, (ii) and (iii) do all the work, according to Gaukroger. It isn’t entirely clear what purpose (i) serves, but Gaukroger argues that it has a role in Descartes’s ethics where it guarantees human freedom. This too affects thought since freedom is what allows us to make truly human judgments (15). (Cf. the Stoics on appearance and assent?)
