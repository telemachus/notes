# Aristocles, Timon, Pyrrho

## Introductory

The title of these notes is already misleading. We have this material fourth-hand not third-hand. Eusebius quotes Aristocles on Timon on Pyrrho. However, Eusebius is not important at all to me in himself, and the title is long enough already. Eusebius introduces this material as part of a discussion of οἱ ἀμφὶ Χενοφάνην. He imagines a line of inheritance from Xenophanes to Parmenides to the atomists and then to Pyrrho. He then describes Pyrrho as the beginning of ἡ τῶν Σκεπτικῶν ἐπικληθέντων διατριβή, and he characterizes their views as (1) αὐτοὺς μηδὲν εἶναι τὸ παράπαν μήτ᾽ἐν αἰσθήσει μήτ᾽ἐν λόγῳ καταληπτὸν ὁριζομένους, (2) ἐπέχοντας δὲ ἐν πᾶσιν. Eusebius introduces Aristocles in order to show how anti-skeptics argued against them, and he claims to quote Aristocles literally (πρὸς λέξιν). (Everyone takes Eusebius at his word on that, but I’m not sure why.)

The work of Aristocles seems to have its own general introduction. Aristocles explains, in good Aristotelian fashion, that first we have to investigate our (capabilities for?) knowledge. If our nature is such that we cannot know anything, then there is little point in investigating anything else.

Aristocles quickly introduces Pyrrho as a particularly strong proponent of skepticism. He explains that Pyrrho wrote nothing himself, and so we rely on what his student Timon wrote. That in turn brings us to the famous ethical introduction of Timon: δεῖν τὸν μέλλοντα εὐδαιμονήσειν εἰς τρία ταῦτα βλέπειν· πρῶτον μέν, ὁποῖα πέφθκε τὰ πράγματα· δεύτερον δέ, τίνα χρὴ τρόπον ἡμᾶς πρὸς αὐτὰ διακεῖσθαι· τελεθταῖον δέ, τί περιέσται τοῖς οὕτως ἔχουσι.

## Questions and answers

Timon has given an ethical structure or wrapper to these epistemological observations. Unlike, say Aristocles himself, the main thrust is not purely epistemological. Some people, e.g. Brunschwig, argue that the *whole* fragment focuses on ethical questions rather than epistemological ones, but I think that this is overstating things. The driving question for Timon and Pyrrho may be ethical, but they may think that the way to reach one’s ethical goals hinges largely on (what we would call) epistemological questions. As a comparison, think of Socrates in the early Platonic dialogues.

In any case, both the questions and answers have a three-part structure. Timon asks these three questions: (i) what is the nature of things (τὰ πράγματα)? (ii) how should we be disposed towards them—that is, these things? (iii) what result will follow for people who are thus disposed? We receive the following answers to those questions: (i-a) things are equally undifferentiated, unstable, and indeterminate, (and) (i-b) therefore neither our sensations nor our opinions are true or false; (ii) as a result, therefore, we should not trust them, but (rather we should) be without opinion, unwavering, and firm (unshaken?), saying of everything that it no more is than it is not or both is and is not or neither is nor is not; (iii) for people who take this attitude, Timon says that first speechlessness follows and then *ataraxia*, (and) Aenesidemus (says or adds) pleasure.

Although the basic structure is clear enough, nearly all of the details are controversial. In particular, it isn’t always clear whether Pyrrho or Timon is answering, and it isn’t clear whether the questions and answers are metaphysical or epistemological or a mix of the two.

The text makes clear that Pyrrho gives the first part of the first answer and that Timon gives the final answer. Brunschwig and Pellegrin have argued that the second part of the first answer belongs to Timon. And in that case, you could easily argue that (1) Timon asks three questions, (2) Pyrrho gives an answer to (i-a), but (3) then Timon himself works up a more elaborate set of answers to his own questions in (i-b), (ii) and (iii).

The one answer that Pyrrho definitely offers has seemed rather dogmatic to many people. That is, Pyrrho appears to declare (even the verb, ἀποφαίνειν, seems too strong) that things *are* undifferentiated, unstable, and indeterminate. Sextus, certainly, would not be happy to make such a declaration in his own voice. Whether this bothers us or not depends on many things, but in particular on whether we think Pyrrho should be a good skeptic by Sextan standards.

## Aenesidemus and the modes (11-12)

In the midst of ragging on Timon and Pyrrho, Aristocles drags in Aenesidemus to rag on him too. According to Aristocles, we can ask of Aenesidemus whether he talked about his nine (sic!) modes knowingly or in ignorance. If he speaks without knowledge, then why should we trust him? If he has knowledge, then he was very foolish to claim that *everything* was unclear and at the same time claim to know so many things.

Setting aside Aristocles’s uncharitable read on skeptical argument in the modes, what does he tell us about the modes? Aristocles refers to differences among animals, people, cities, lives, customs and laws. He also says that according to Aenesidemus the sense are weak and many external things impede knowledge; for example, distances, sizes, and motions. In addition, there are different dispositions for young versus old people, people who are awake versus those who are sleeping, and healthy versus sick people. According to Aenesidemus it is impossible to grasp anything simple and unmixed; instead everything is mixed together and spoken of relative (to something else).

## Aristocles’s responses

For the most part, Aristocles tries to show that the arguments of Timon and Pyrrho are self-defeating or pointless. A good example is §5, where he argues as follows:

1. When they argue that everything is undifferentiated and they therefore order us to believe nothing, does this mean that people who believe things differ are wrong?
1. If so, then these people believe incorrectly.
1. If that is the case, then some people believe falsehoods while Timon and Pyrrho speak the truth (on these same matters?).
1. Thus, contrary to what they say, there is truth and falsity.
1. If people who believe that things differ are not wrong, then why do Timon and Pyrrho reproach us? In what way is their knowledge greater than anyone else’s? After all, if the others are *not* wrong, then Timon and Pyrrho themselves *are* wrong since they claim that things do not differ.

In §18, Aristocles offers a version of “If god is dead, everything is permitted” against the skeptics. He argues that someone who goes along with skepticism would do anything since such a person (i) wouldn’t think things are themselves fine or shameful, just or injust, given the skeptical arguments that nothing really has such qualities; and (ii) such a person wouldn’t fear laws or punishments, given their ἀπάθεια.

In §21-22, Aristocles makes a notable argument against the analogy of skeptical arguments to cathartic drugs. The skeptics want to claim that their arguments are like such drugs insofar as they clear out themselves along with all other beliefs. However, Aristocles points out that the analogy breaks down. The cathartic drug leaves the body when it works, but the skeptical drug must remain in the mind in order to make people without beliefs. The skeptics might reject this claim, but I wonder if they do so on pain of pretty strong irrationality. I.e., skeptics could say that going forward the person rejects things without relying on an argument, but where does that really get them?

## Madness and dreams

1. Now they are mad far beyond cure (4.7).
1. Aenesidemus contrasts people awake and people asleep (4.11).
1. When Timon met Pyrrho walking towards the Pythian games, did Pyrrho know why he was walking the way he was? Or was he like insane people wandering along the road? (4.15)
1. If things were truly the way that skeptics claim that they are, then we would live irrationally and madly like in a dream (4.25).
1. Other people seem to live life in accordance with nature, but the skeptics alone are conceited, or rather are very insane(4.25).
