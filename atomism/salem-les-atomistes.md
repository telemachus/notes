# Les atomistes de l’antiquité: Démocrite, Épicure, Lucrèce (Jean Salem)

## Leucippe et Démocrite

Salem won’t go as far as Epicurus, who said that Leucippus did not exist, but he does think that we can leave Leucippus almost entirely on the sidelines while talking about Democritus. He chooses to mention Leucippus only in passing, when the testimony about him is relevant to whatever Salem is saying about Democritus.

Salem notes that we have three possible birthdates for Democritus: 460 (10 years later than Socrates), 470 or 469 (a year before Socrates), or 494 (roughly 30 years before Socrates). He goes with the latest date, 460. This means that Democritus was born, according to Salem, around ten years later than Socrates.

Salem proposes four main sources that we should consider in order to understand Democritus:
1. the fragments in Diels-Kranz and Luria;
2. the works of Aristotle, who often has Democritus in mind even if he does not name him;
3. the Hippocratic corpus;
4. scholarly literature about Democritus over the last hundred years or so.

Salem arranges his coverage of Democritus into eight areas:
1. general atomic principles;
2. details of astronomy and meteorology;
3. epistemology;
4. theory of the soul and psychology;
5. living creatures, theory of generation in the medical corpus and Aristotle;
6. anthropology;
7. ethics;
8. the legends and false stories that accumulated around Democritus in the ancient tradition.

### Physique Générale

Salem begins with another analogy for atomism: letters. Atomists believed that the differences between atomic compounds depend on the differences of the order and positions of atoms that make up the compounds. To help explain this, Salem refers to letters. Atoms differ in shape, as A differs from N. Atoms differ in order, as AN differs from NA. And atoms differ in position as Z differs from N. (This last example is not exact, and Salem uses a slightly differnt example, but you get the idea.)

Salem is at pains to emphasize the empirical character of Democritean atomist. He vigorously denies that atomism is merely a logical reaction to Parmenides and Zeno. Likewise, he insists that when the atomists argue for void, the claim that movement exists is “expérimentale.” However, what he means here by “experiemental” is not entirely clear to me. He doens’t seem to mean that these atomists conducted actual experiments. He seems, rather, to mean “experiential.” So, for example, immediately after he first says that the atomists rely “sur une constatation *expérimentale*” (28, his emphasis), he writes, “laquelle constatation dérive d’une information qui nous est fournie et sans cesse confirmée par les *sens*” (28, his emphasis).

### Cosmogonie, Astronomie, et Météorologie

I’m not especially concerned with these topics, so I won’t go into any detail about this chapter. But Salem makes an interesting point towards the end of the chapter. He argues that scholars like Burnet, Bréhier, and Guthrie unfairly accuse Democritus of borrowing from Anaximander and Anaximenes. It is unfair because they could instead see Democritus as overlapping with Anaxagoras. Democritus and Anaxagoras were rough contemporaries. If you focus on the similarities of these two, then Democritus no longer looks like someone naively copying work from over a hundred years earlier.

### Théorie de la Connaissance

Salem begins by discussing the Democritean theory of perception. He argues that it is neither a simple extromission nor a simple intromission theory. Instead, Salem believes that Democritus has a unique theory that combines elements of both: atoms fly off of things in sheets towards us, and other creatures with sensory awareness, (intromission), but at the same time our eyes (and other senses, I presume?) send forth particles (extromission). These groups of particles meet and *then* enter our eyes (or other senses). Salem follows Luria in this theory. I suppose that Democritus may have believed in such a theory, but if so, so much the worse for him.

In terms of epistemology, Salem believes that Democritus was neither an empiricist nor a rationalist. Instead, Democritus was somewhere in the middle. He believed, according to Salem, that the senses gave only “connaissance bâtard,” that reason gave “connaisance légitime,” but also that (all?) knowledge began with or relied on the information provided by the senses.

### Psychologie

Salem argues that Democritus had a naturalistic theory of the soul and of life. The soul is made up of very fine, fast, small, and spherical atoms. Life depends on a critical mass of such atoms. These atoms are closely connected with breath and respiration. Sleep occurs when breathing is more shallow, and death when breath stops. These atoms are also especially warm and associated with fire.

### Médicine

Salem presents two types of similarities between Democritus and the Hippocratic corpus. First, there are general similarities: they embrace physicalism and naturalistic, rational explanations while rejecting religious or superstitious explanations. Second, there are specifics. Salem lists seven theses that Democritus shares with Hippocratic writers. These theses especially concern pregnancy and gestation in humans. (See pages 59-60 for details.)

Salem notes that many scholars deny the connection between Democritus and the Hippocratic corpus, but he supports his claim with an indirect argument from Aristotle. Other scholars point out (i) that the Hippocratic writers never mention Democritus or atoms explicitly and (ii) that the Hippocratic has an independent history, separate from philosophy. However, Salem replies that Aristotle, in his *On the generation of animals*, specifically and by name argues against Democritus when he argues against exactly the theses that Salem has listed earlier. This suggests that Aristotle believed that the Hippocratic authors shared these views with Democritus, or at least that Aristotle thought that these views belonged to Democritus.
