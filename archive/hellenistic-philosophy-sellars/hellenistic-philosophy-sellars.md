+ Sellars recommends IG or LS as readers.

## Introduction

+ Contemporary philosophers still tend to raise up Plato and Aristotle and diminish Stoics, skeptics, and Epicureans (1-2)
+ However, many key ideas in early modern and Enlightenment philosophy come from Hellenistic philosophers. In fact, philosophers during that period looked to Hellenistic thinkers more than Plato and Arisotle. The Hellenistic schools helped to form our modern outlook on the world, and they are more in tune with that outlook than Plato or Aristotle.
+ Plato and Aristotle only took the lead in the nineteenth century. Sellars attributes this (partly?) to luck: we have far more whole texts from Plato and Aristotle.
+ Hellenistic philosophy “was also intensely practical” (2). And yet, they also considered highly technical topics, many of which are still of interest today. Sellars mentions “vagueness and topics in modal logic” (3).

## What, When, Where, and Who

+ Sellars traces the term “Hellenistic” to Droysen’s history. As such it refers to the period from 323 to 31. During this period Alexander’s generals fought over his vast domain, and at the end of the period Rome took over.
+ Although the dates do not line up exactly, significant changes did occur during the historical period. As Sellars says, “around 300 BC the philosophical landscape in Athens changed considerably” (6). Around the time of the siege of Athens (86 BCE), the center of gravity shifted away from Athens and towards Italy.
+ Sellars wonders whether anything beyond time and place unite these schools. He considers “therapeutic,” but for the moment he doesn’t commit himself one way or the other.
+ Epicurus founded his garden first. He bought the land around 306 BCE and founded a community outside of Athens. Hermarchus, Metrodorus, and Polyaenus were key figures alongside Epicurus. The Epicureans admitted women as well as men. We have names for heads of the Garden down to the late 50s, but the physical site was likely destroyed during Sulla’s siege of Athens in 86.[^1]
+ Zeno set up shop in Athens roughly around the time of Epicurus. However, he was not a citizen, and he didn’t have enough money to buy land. Zeno studied with Cynics and then Stilpo of Megara, who was interested in Cynic ethics and Megarian logic. Stilpo may have anticipated the Stoic view that “a good life is one free from emotions” (16). Finally, Zeno also studied with Xenocrates and Polemo in the Academy.
+ Unlike Epicurus and Zeno, both of whom established new schools in Athens around 300 BCE, Plato’s Academy was already an important cultural site by that time. Arcesilaus became head of the Academy around 268, and he radically changed the school’s style. Previous heads devoted attention to “doctrinal Platonism” (20), but Arcesilaus initiated a skeptical wave.
+ Academics and Stoics both made claims to be the heirs of Socrates. Academics relied on their inheritance from Plato, and Stoics pointed towards their connection to the Cynics, who had developed many of their ideas from Socrates.
+ Early Pyrrhonism develops in the first century when Philo moves towards reliablism and Antiochus develops a syncretic philosophy made up of Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. In response to such changes, Aenesidemus turned towards Pyrrho as an inspiration towards radical skepticism.[^2] Pyrrho’s life was odd, and he may have been influenced by Indian thinkers.[^3]
+ Sellars reminds us of the Lyceum and Theophrastus as an additional Hellenistic school and thinker.

## Knowledge

+ The three primary schools see philosophy “as something practical, existential, and life changing” (32). Nevertheless, according to Sellars, the schools care a great deal about knowledge and what exists because they want to get their practical matters right.[^4]

### Epicurean Epistemology

+ Epicurus kicks off Hellenistic epistemology. He is a staunch, commonsense empiricist. We get knowledge of the world from our senses.
+ At the same time, Epicurus defends the highly paradoxical view that all our sensations (αἰσθήσεις) are true.
+ To defend this view, Sellars points to DL 10.32, where Epicurus offers these four arguments: (i) a perception of one sense cannot refute another of the same sense since they all have equal strength; (ii) a perception from one sense cannot refute another from another sense since they have different objects; (iii) reason cannot refute sense perceptions since reasoning depends on sense perceptions; (iv) one sense-perception cannot refute another since we attend to them all; (also?) our awareness of sense-percetions testifies to their truth: just as we feel pain, we see and hear.
+ In order to deal with error, Epicurus distinguishes between sensation, which is always of what is real and which is unerring, and judgment, which can be right or wrong.
+ Sellars believes that Epicurus made the paradoxical claim in order to fend off skeptical attacks. For example, a skeptic might say if you can doubt any of your sense-perceptions then there is no good reason not to doubt all of them. If one perception can be misleading, so can the rest” (36).
+ Epicurus advances his theory of preconceptions in order to respond to Meno’s paradox. Preconceptions themselves come from repeated encounters with similar objects, though a process of abstraction.

### Stoic Logic and Epistemology

+ The Stoics, especially Chrysippus, are second only to Aristotle in terms of contributions to logic.
+ While Aristotelian logic is term-based, Stoic logic is propositional.
+ Chrysippus proposed five “indemonstrable” argument forms: (i) if p, then q; p; therefore q; (ii) if p, then q; not q; therefore not p;[^5] (iii) not (p and q); p; therefore not q; (iv) p or q; not p; therefore q; (v) either p or q; not q; therefore p.
+ According to the Stoics, the bar for knowledge is very high, and only the sage meets it. It requires a large and systematically organized set of grasps. (My terminology, not Sellars’s, but I don’t want to use “belief” of Stoic katalêpsis.)
+ However, knowledge is built on everyday examples of cognition (katalêpsis), such as “it is day.” This type of cognition begins with the senses, just as in Epicurus.
+ CRITICISM Sellars mentions “causal history,” but he doesn’t make clear what is at stake in terms of different interpretations of Stoic epistemology. He says nothing explicit re externalism versus internalism.

### Arguments in the Academy

+ CRITICISM When Sellars lays out the Academic response to Stoic *apraxia* arguments, he doesn’t do them justice. He doesn’t explain, for example, that Arcesilaus can rely on what is reasonable just as a Stoic proficiens can.
+ It’s unclear what, if anything, Arcesilaus and Carneades really believed.
+ Even in antiquity, people fought over Carneades especially. Clitomachus thought Carneades was still a radical skeptic while Metrodorus argued for a view where Carneades allowed the wise person to hold opinions, but “holding opinions *as* opinions” (49), as Cicero puts it.
+ Debate over these issues causes the Academy to split into several factions. Philo initially agreed with Clitomachus, but then went over to Metrodorus’s view. Antiochus went in for a blend of Stoic, Platonic, and Aristotelian views. Aenesidemus revived Pyrrhonism.
+ Antiochus anticipates late ancient neoPlatonism in the way he blends Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics together.

### The Pyrrhonist Revival

+ In a way, it’s not a revival but an invention since Pyrrho had next to know followers and nobody really cared about him by the time Aenesidemus got started.
+ According to Sellars, there are at least three Pyrrhonisms: Pyrrho’s, Aenesidemus’s, and Sextus’s. People usually (or unaware) mean Sextus’s when they talk about Pyrrhonism.
+ Aenesidemus objects to later Academics as “Stoics fighting Stoics” and to earlier Academics as, essentially, negative dogmatists.[^6]
+ Aenesidemus probably first compiled the ten modes (and the eight as well).
+ Sellars alludes to the problem if a skeptic consciously uses the modes to induce suspension of judgment, they seem to have decided to abandon inquiry.[^7]
+ Contrary to what Sextus says, Sellars views Aenesidemus as very close to Arcesilaus in several ways.

### Pyrrho and Timon

+ Sellars takes the ontological rather than epistemological view of Pyrrho. He follows LS and Bett.
+ Sellars rejects Zellar’s emendation of the Aristocles fragment.[^8]
+ Everything we know about Pyrrho, however, derives from Timon, and we don’t know how much of this material comes from Timon and how much from Pyrrho himself.
There’s a big difference between Epicureans and Stoics, on the one side, and Academics and Pyrrhonians on the other. And yet, they all agree that false beliefs will lead to trouble and that getting things right lead to *ataraxia*.

## Nature

### Hellenistic Theology and Academic Objections

Sellars sympathizes with ancient critics who argued that Epicurus was a closet atheist (76-77). He criticizes Epicurus for relying on the *consensus omnium* when arguing for the existence of the gods. However, Sellars also speculates that Epicurus might have maintained the status quo in religion in order to lead, and help others lead, a tranquil life (78).

Sellars considers various Stoic arguments for the existence of the gods. In some cases, the Stoics argued from design (79), and in other cases, they argued in what looks like an ontological argument of some kind (79-80). The orderly movements of the stars and other celestial bodies suggest that they have reason (80).

Academics criticize all of these arguments, but they focus on the Stoics. The order in the universe does not require gods; it may be merely how nature operates (i.e., randomly?) (81). If they gods are immortal, they cannot be corporeal since everything corporeal is mortal (81).

## The Self

## The Good

## Finitude

This chapter does not have unity: it’s a grab bag of ideas bound thinly by the word “finitude.”

## Community

Does Cicero have to change schools? Maybe he simply can’t imagine skepticism in politics, and so there he goes syncretist.

## Typos

+ Page 39, “Seem *so* be seen” should surely be “Seem *to* be seen.” This is in a quotation of Melville’s Lucretius.
+ Page 199, *pusikos* should be *phusikos* (see *phusiologia* above).

[^1]: CRITICISM “According to Jerome, Cicero prepared...” (note 29, 14). Would a student have any idea who Jerome is?

[^2]: ERROR “According to one ancient writer on this question, it is almost meaningless to concern ourselves with what Pyrrho believed, given that he did not hold any positive views; instead we should reserve the label ‘Pyrrhonian’ to those who follow Pyrrho’s way of life” (26). Then in note 90, Sellars adds, “See Diog. Laert. 9.70, citing Theodosius.” This completely misunderstands DL 9.70.

[^3]: CRITICISM No mention of Beckwith here, though he is in the bibliography.

[^4]: CRITICISM I wonder, however, if this grounds more than an instrumental view of reason, knowledge, and the rest of philosophy. As an example, think about Sextus on bad arguments. “Neither school thought that one could believe anything one liked, so long as it has the right therapeutic effect” (32-33). Does either school actually *defend* such a counterfactual claim?

[^5]: ERROR Sellars turns the valid Stoic second indemonstrable into the fallacy of denying the antecedent. He writes “If the first, then the second; not the first; therefore not the second” (40).

[^6]: QUESTION I wonder if this is true or whether Sellars himself is too influenced by Sextus.

[^7]: CRITICISM This is too quick. The skeptic might be testing views during inquiry using the modes. This doesn’t have to be in bad faith.

[^8]: CRITICISM Weirdly, he refers to Julia Annas’s *Morality of Happiness* as his example of the other view, rather than any of the longer pieces by Barnes.

[^9]: CRITICISM Sellars cites Brunschwig’s papers as if it were a book, by page numbers only, without citing the title of the article within.
