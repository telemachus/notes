# "Republic 2: Questions about Justice" in *Plato 2: Ethics, Politics, Religion, and the Soul* ed. Gail Fine (Oxford, OUP; 1999)

## Glaucon's dissatisfaction

At the start of Book 2, Glaucon tells Socrates that he is not satisfied with the Socratic defense of justice from Book 1. Irwin highlights that it may not be immediately clear *why* or *in what way* Glaucon is dissatisfied. Irwin picks out two elements from Glaucon's speech that may be important:

1. Glaucon wants Socrates to show that justice is better than injustice "in every way." Socrates had not gone nearly this far when he debated Thrasymachus. So in this respect, we may think Socrates has to do *more* than he did in Book 1.
2. Glaucon asks for a proof that the just life is *better than* the injust life. Such a relative request allows for the possibility that the just person is still unhappy overall, but better off than the injust person. Socrates, however, argued in Book 1 that the just life was a good life. So in this respect, we may think that Socrates argued for *too much* in Book 1.

However, Irwin only raises these two possibilities on the basis of initial clues. He says that we must investigate further in order to see precisely what Glaucon wants from Socrates now and how he was unsatisfied with the earlier argument.

## The classification of goods

Glaucon offers a threefold division of goods:

1. Some things are good for their own sake but not for their consequences (357b4-8).
2. Some things are good both for their own sake and for their consequences (357c2-4).
3. Some things are good for their consequences but not for their own sake (357c6-d2).

Glaucon uses harmless pleasures as an example of the first type; presumably he specifies "harmless" pleasures because if the pleasure led to some awful aftereffect than we would not want it, or not as unreservedly as we might otherwise. Glaucon lists thought, sight, and health as examples of the second type of good. Glaucon gives exercise, medicine, and moneymaking as examples of the third type.

Socrates believes that justice is a good of the second type, which he adds is "the finest" of the three types (358a1). Glaucon doesn't explicitly agree, but he tells Socrates that he has not yet proven that justice belongs in the second type. Most people believe it to be in the third type, according to Glaucon, something worth pursuing only because of its consequences and, in fact, something that we would avoid (as too difficult) if it didn't have such good consequences (358a4-6). *This*, it seems, is where Glaucon finds the previous arguments lacking. Socrates has not yet shown that justice is worth pursuing both for its own sake and for the sake of its consequences, and *this* is what Glaucon demands of him now.
