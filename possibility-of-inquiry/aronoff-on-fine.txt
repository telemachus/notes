Gail Fine published 'Inquiry in the <i>Meno</i>' in 1992[[1]], and after twenty-plus years of related work, her <i>Possibility of Inquiry</i> offers a detailed investigation into ancient philosophers on inquiry. In addition to Plato, <i>The Possibility of Inquiry</i> considers Aristotle, Epicureans, Stoics, Skeptics and Plutarch. This book is challenging and thought-provoking, and it will certainly become the default starting point for future research. Fine cares deeply about Meno's paradox itself, but she also uses it to illuminate ancient epistemology more broadly Thus this book should find a wide audience among scholars of ancient philosophy. (Although the writing is clear and jargon-free and no knowledge of Greek is required, the work places heavy demands on its readers. Advanced undergraduates might be able to read it, but they are not the target audience.)

Roughly half of the book is about the <i>Meno</i>, and Fine's discussion of Plato is the heart of the volume. As Fine notes in the introduction, she can be briefer in the second half of the book because she has clarified so many details while discussing Plato (3). She also believes that Plato was the first to take up the problem of inquiry seriously and that he "devotes more attention to our main concerns than" the other thinkers (3). I will follow Fine and focus on Plato.

Fine argues that the debate between Meno and Socrates about inquiry depends on a misunderstanding, and she downplays the importance of the theory of recollection in Socrates' response to Meno. Some key points of Fine's interpretation:[[2]]

<q>
1. When Socrates disavows knowledge, he means that he lacks what she calls P-knowledge.[[3]] Socrates' disavowal is consistent with his having true beliefs and strong convictions about the same things he disavows knowledge of.

2. Meno, however, misinterprets his and Socrates' lack of knowledge. Meno thinks that he and Socrates are "in a cognitive blank" about what they do not know (82; see also the General Index <i>sv</i> 'cognitive blank').

3. As a result of his confusion, Meno poses the paradox of inquiry: how can you even inquire about something, if you are in a cognitive blank about that matter (80d5-8)? Socrates accepts this puzzle as important and restates it more formally as a dilemma (80e1-5).

4. Socrates answers the dilemma via a distinction between true belief and knowledge. Meno is correct that it is impossible to inquire into something, if you are in a cognitive blank about it. But Socrates is not in a cognitive blank about virtue. The discussion about geometry between Socrates and a slave (82b-85c) is proof by example. The slave does not know the answer to Socrates' initial question, but he has many true beliefs about geometry, and he can gain new true beliefs, and eventually even knowledge, by inquiring.

5. The distinction between true belief and knowledge proves that inquiry is possible. The theory of recollection, however, is less central. Its aim is to show how inquiry can be successful. In addition, Plato is unfortunately vague about recollection: "Plato doesn't spell out the details of <i>how</i> recollection plays this explanatory role" (165).

6. Plato does not argue for nor rely on innate knowledge in the <i>Meno</i>. Instead, Plato only relies on prenatal knowledge: before birth a person's incorporeal soul possesses knowledge, but that knowledge is lost upon birth when a soul enters a body.
</q>

Fine's analysis is patient, detailed, insightful, and philosophically rich. Although I will focus on two disagreements below, I want to stress that every serious reader of Plato's <i>Meno</i> will profit from considering Fine's careful interpretation.

We should be very surprised by the claim that Meno takes himself and Socrates to be in a cognitive blank concerning virtue. When Meno challenges Socrates with the paradox of inquiry, he and Socrates have been engaged in a discussion of virtue for ten Stephanus pages. They have each asked questions about and stated opinions about virtue. It seems highly uncharitable to claim that Meno has forgotten this and now believes that he and Socrates are completely without cognitive content about virtue. (Fine doesn't discuss this problem, so I'm unsure how she would reply to it.[[4]])

When Fine uses the phrase "in a cognitive blank", she cannot mean simply "be very confused about". It would be easy enough to show that by 80d5 Meno has become very confused about virtue. He admits as much himself in the famous analogy where he compares Socrates to a torpedo fish (80b). But being very confused and being in a cognitive blank about something are not the same. And Fine makes it very clear (e.g., 70-71) that she means the stronger claim. According to Fine, Meno treats the following as exclusive options, subject to the Law of the Excluded Middle:

<q>
1. Meno has knowledge about virtue.
2. Meno is in a cognitive blank about virtue.
</q>

As I've argued above, this doesn't suit the context of Meno's paradox, but in addition it is inherently implausible—what would motivate anyone to believe this?When Socrates disavows <i>knowledge</i> of virtue, his audience is always shocked. How could a contemporary Greek believe that they have no cognitive content about virtue whatsoever? Fine raises the general difficulty, but her discussion is disappointingly brief and halfhearted (82-83). She wonders "[w]hy might Meno have misunderstood Socrates" as saying that not knowing is tantamount to being in a cognitive blank, but she doesn't seem sufficiently worried about how extreme and odd a position this is.

My second concern is that Fine minimizes the theory of recollection. Fine argues that Socrates replies to Meno in three stages: (1) initial mention of the theory of recollection, (2) an interlude where Socrates cross-examines one of Meno's slaves about geometry and (3) a second discussion of recollection. It is unobjectionable to claim that there are three stages here. However, Fine tends to describe stage two as if it were something distinct from the theory of recollection. On her interpretation, the cross-examination proves that inquiry is possible, while recollection is meant to show how inquiry can succeed. However, Fine also believes Plato doesn't describe recollection in sufficient detail for us to say much about it.[[5]]

I have trouble accepting that recollection and the cross-examination are so distinct. After Meno poses the paradox of inquiry and Socrates reformulates it as a dilemma, Meno asks Socrates if it appears to him to be a good argument. Socrates says no, and gives as his reason the story he has heard from priests and poets: namely recollection. He appears to argue <i>that</i> inquiry is possible because of recollection. This already suggests to me that Fine may misjudge what recollection attempts to show. Second, the cross-examination of the slave does break away from recollection, which appears to be Fine's view. Socrates asks to speak with one of Meno's slaves precisely because Meno wants Socrates to demonstrate more clearly what he means by recollection. So, when Socrates leads the slave through questions about geometry, he hasn't left recollection for another topic. Socrates' introduction of recollection, in what Fine calls the first stage, was allusive and brief. The cross-examination of the slave is a way of making recollection clearer and more vivid to Meno (and by implication to Plato's audience at the same time).

Turning to the book's second half, the Skeptics, who are the subject of Fine's last two chapters, are in a unique position with regard to the paradox of inquiry. Aristotle, the Epicureans and the Stoics need to answer the paradox no less than Plato. For all these thinkers, it is crucial that successful inquiry is possible. For the Skeptics, however, the paradox of inquiry is simply another battleground in their war against dogmatic philosophers. Fine shows how Stoics and Epicureans both try to use the paradox of inquiry against Skeptics and how Skeptics in turn argue that the paradox supports them against Stoics and Epicureans. In a nutshell, Stoics and Epicureans claim that Skeptics can't inquire since they don't even know what they're talking about or looking for, and Skeptics respond that only they can inquire since Stoics and Epicureans believe they know the truth—arguing that you don't look for what you already think you have. These chapters make many interesting observations, particularly concerning whether or not the Skeptics think that they can do entirely without belief. But we also learn how flexible the paradox of inquiry was in antiquity. It was not only a puzzle to be solved, but also a stick to use against your philosophical rivals.

This was, of course, already true for Meno and Plato's <i>Meno</i>. When Meno first raises the paradox of inquiry, he is floundering as a result of Socratic elenchus. Dramatically, what he seems to have wanted was simply to turn the tables: let's see Socrates answer <i>that</i> puzzle. Fine has taken up the challenge and turned it into a valuable opportunity to investigate both the paradox itself and its many wider ramifications.

[[3]] The phrase 'P-knowledge' is simply shorthand for Plato's definition of knowledge, as understood by Fine. She uses A-knowledge, S-knowledge and E-knowledge for Aristotle, Stoics and Epicureans.

[[4]] To his credit, Dominic Scott, who shares the "cognitive blank" interpretation with Fine, raises the problem of context. However, he doesn't give much of an answer. His implicit answer seems to be simply that Meno isn't very bright (76-77).

[[5]] In the earlier 'Inquiry in the Meno', Fine wrote "However one spells out the details of the theory of recollection, few nowadays are likely to believe it. The elenctic reply, however, remains convincing, and it can be accepted even by one who rejects the theory of recollection; one can accept Plato's claim that one can inquire in the absence of knowledge, because of one's capacity for reflection and because of one's true beliefs, without accepting his account of what explains the capacity and the beliefs" (64). The elenctic reply is the conversation between Socrates and the slave, and what explains the capacity and the beliefs is the theory of recollection.
