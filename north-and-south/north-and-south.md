# *North and South* Elizabeth Gaskell

## Volume I

Mr. Hale and Mr. Thorton have a revealing conversation about the classics.

> "But you have the rudiments of a good education," remarked Mr. Hale.
> "The quick zest with which you are now reading Homer,
> shows me that you do not come to it as an unknown book:
> you have read it before, and are only recalling your old knowledge."
>
> "That is true,—I had blundered along it at school;
> I dare say, I was even considered a pretty fair classic in those days,
> though my Latin and Greek have slipt away from me since.
> But I ask you, what preparation were they for such a life as I had to lead?
> None at all.
> Utterly none at all.
> On the point of education,
> any man who can read and write starts fair with me in the amount of really useful knowledge that I had at that time."
>
> "Well!
> I don’t agree with you.
> But there I am perhaps somewhat of a pedant.
> Did not the recollection of the heroic simplicity of the Homeric life nerve you up?"
>
> "Not one bit!" exclaimed Mr. Thornton, laughing.
> "I was too busy to think about any dead people,
> with the living pressing alongside of me, neck to neck, in the struggle for bread.
> Now that I have my mother safe in the quiet peace that becomes her age,
> and duly rewards her former exertions,
> I can turn to all that old narration and thoroughly enjoy it."
>
> "I dare say,
> my remark came from the professional feeling of there being nothing like leather,"
> replied Mr. Hale.

After Mr. Thorton and Mr. Hale talk,
Margaret avoids shaking hands with Thorton—for the first but not last time.

> When Mr. Thornton rose up to go away, after shaking hands with Mr. and Mrs. Hale,
> he made an advance to Margaret to wish her good-bye in a similar manner.
> It was the frank familiar custom of the place; but Margaret was not prepared for it.
> She simply bowed her farewell;
> although the instant she saw the hand, half put out, quickly drawn back,
> she was sorry she had not been aware of the intention.
> Mr. Thornton, however, knew nothing of her sorrow,
> and, drawing himself up to his full height, walked off,
> muttering as he left the house—
>
> "A more proud, disagreeable girl I never saw.
> Even her great beauty is blotted out of one’s memory by her scornful ways" (85).

Fanny reveals something important about conscience and shame.
She cares too much what others think and not enough about her own conduct.

> 'Mr. Thornton!
> Does he really find time to read with a tutor,
> in the midst of all this business,—and this abominable strike in hand as well?'
>
> Fanny was not sure, from Mrs. Slickson's manner,
> whether she ought to be proud of ashamed of her brother's conduct;
> and, like all people who try and take other people's 'ought' for the rule of their feelings,
> she was included to blush for any singularity of action.
> Her shame was interrupted by the dispersion of the guests (165).

After Margaret protects Mr. Thorton from the strikers, she cannot sleep.
She feels shame, but I am uncertain why or at what.

> She lay down and never stirred.
> To move hand or foot, or even so much as one finger,
> would have been an exertion beyond the powers of volition or motion.
> She was so tired, so stunned, that she thought she never slept at all;
> her feverish thoughts passed and repassed the boundary between sleeping and waking,
> and kept their own miserable identity.
> She could not be alone, prostrate, powerless as she was,—a cloud of faces looked up at her,
> giving her no idea of fierce vivid anger, or of personal danger,
> but a deep sense of shame that she could thus be the object of universal regard—a
> sense of shame so acute that it seemed as if she would fain have burrowed
> into the earth to hide herself,
> and yet she could not escape out of that unwinking glare of many eyes (191-192).
