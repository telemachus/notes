# *Ancient Philosophy*, William J. Prior

## Introduction

### Socrates

Socrates wanted people ‘to ask themselves how they ought to live. He did not want to *tell* them how to live, only to get them to think about the question for themselves’ (xiii).

Prior defines philosophy as ‘a life of inquiry into the most basic questions one can ask, a search for understanding’ (xiv). He believes that the best way to study ancient philosophy is to start with Socrates’s question. And he explicitly sets aside the Presocratics. Their initial question is about the nature of the world: ‘what is its ruling principle, its ultimate cause’ (xv). Prior sees this question as the ancestor of modern science, but he considers the Socratic question primary. All other questions should follow the question ‘How should we live?’ (xv-xvi). Along these lines, Prior also quotes approvingly Cicero’s comment that Socrates brought down philosophy from the sky and into cities and even people’s houses.
