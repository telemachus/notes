## Introduction

Leibniz told a correspondent that Descartes’s ethics were “largely derivative from Seneca and amounted to no more than a morality of patience without hope”. For Leibniz, morality must give us hope and must depend on our immortality and the judgment of a just god.

Even worse, Henry Sidgwick argued that Descartes does not tough on ethics. This is clearly wrong: Descartes talks about morals in several works, and his *Passions of the Soul* is explicitly and entirely on morals.

Descartes belied that morality should not depend on our views about god and immortality. “What Leibniz saw as a weakness, therefore, Descartes claimed as a strength” (2).

In his *Principles of Philosophy* Descartes compares all of philosophy to a tree. The roots are metaphysics and the trunk is physics. The branches are all the other sciences. Three of the most important of which are medicine, mechanics, and morals. Descartes argues that a “perfect moral system” requires “complete knowledge of the other sciences and is the ultimate level of wisdom” (AT 9B, 14). Since Descartes argues that his ethics requires his metaphysics and we (largely) reject his metaphysics, can we still salvage his ethics?

Perhaps we can if we take his ethics to be “a system of Kantian hypothetical imperatives” (2). That is, given that we want a specified set of ends, we should use whatever we take to be our best current knowledge in order to achieve these ends. Marshall argues that some of what Descartes says might seem to go in this direction, but not all of what he says can be squared with such a view. He argues that several passages in Descartes suggest that morality is not merely “applied natural science”.

In particular, the part of Cartesian morality concerned with values, norms, and moral virtue does not depend on anything from his natural science. For examples of this, Marshall points to the dedicatory letter to Elizabeth that Descartes wrote for the 1644 edition of the *Principles* in Latin, as well as his *morale par provision* from the *Discours* (4). Although this material does not depend on anything from the specific sciences, it does still depend on Cartesian metaphysics. So, in this sense, the analogy of the tree is still true for Descartes.

Although we reject much of Cartesian metaphysics, we cannot reject all of the *cogito* and the *cogito* has a great deal of importance for morality. The truth of “our own agency and autonomy” is central to ethics and to Cartesian metaphysics (4). Even if we reject some of the implications that Descartes drew from his *cogito* (e.g., a substantial soul, dualism, etc.), our ethics still require us to “see ourselves as agents possessing autonomy so long as we entertain the practical question, What should I do?” (4-5). The question is essential normative. It thus assumes our rationality and our autonomy (5).

Once we step outside of the perspective of the *cogito*, however, our reasons may appear very different. Internally, our practical judgments may seem intrinsically and essentially good or correct. And yet “From an outer perspective our putative reasons and practical judgments can be seen to be products of our culture or other causes of which we are not aware and over which we have no control” (5). Although Descartes strove to achieve an absolute point of view, immune to such considerations and doubts, for metaphysics and the domain of theory, for morality and the domain of practice he considered this impossible. In this sense, the relativity of the *morale par provision* may be inescapable.
